FEATURES
**Paragon Power.** Graxis has 5 Paragon Power, and regains all spent power at the beggining of his next turn. At the end of another creature's turn, he may either:
1. **Move:** Graxis can move up to its base speed if it is free to do so. This movement may trigger opportunity attacks and reactions as normal.
2. **Perform an Action:** Graxis can perform a single action—such as a single Attack, Dodge, or Help.
3. **Resist:** Graxis regains its reaction and can make saving throws against any ongoing damage or effect.

**Paragon Defence (2/day).** When Graxis would fail a saving throw, he may spend 10 hit points to succeed instead.

**Reckless.** At the start of its turn, Graxis can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls he makes during that turn, but attack rolls against him have advantage until the start of his next turn.

**Labirinthian Curse.** Graxis can move through spaces as small as 5 ft. without squeezing. Graxis regains 1d10 hit points at the start of his turn. If he's bloodied, this value increases to 2d10.

ACTIONS
**Multiattack.** Graxis makes three attacks with the Axe of Xander or with his Thrashing Horns attack.

**Axe of Xander.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d12 + 2d6 + 7  damage. On a crit all other creatures within 5ft of the target take 2d6 damage.

**Thrashing Horns.** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8+ 5 damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked 5 ft. away from Graxis.

**Overwhelming Charge.** Graxis moves in a line up to his speed, passing through enemies and pushing them aside with his horns. Every creature on Graxis' path must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 4d8 damage and be shoved 5 ft. in a direction of Graxis' choice, falling prone. On a success, the target takes half damage and is pushed, but doesn't fall prone.
If a target succeeds against this saving throw by 5 or more, they instead stop Graxis on his tracks and his speed is reduced to zero until the end of his current turn.

**Dead Hunter's Roar.** Graxis bellows, even the walls trembling at his rage. Any creature who can hear Graxis must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. Save at end of turn.

**Cursed Blood (Bloodied).** Graxis uses his open wounds to throw blood into a 30 ft. cone, and creatures that come into contact with it become blind with rage. Any targets caught in the area must succeed against a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes blinded until the end of their next turn, and must use their next turn moving towards the nearest creature and attacking it if possible. If there is more than one creature in range, their target is random.

REACTIONS
**Vertical Onslaught.** Whenever an enemy moves into, out of or within Graxis' reach, he can spend his reaction to headbutt them into the ground. Make a Thrashing Horns attack. If it hits, the target takes no damage and isn't pushed away, but is instead knocked prone and have their movement speed reduced to 0 until the beginning of their next turn.

**Shield of Xander's Roar (3/day):** Whenever hit, Graxis can spend his reaction to animate the shield and make it roar, causing the effects of the Thunderwave spell.

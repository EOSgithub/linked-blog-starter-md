# Xander's Axe
_Weapon (battleaxe), very rare (requires attunement)_

This battleaxe forged from fallen starmetal bears the distinctive craftsmanship of distant lands beyond Thylea's shores. This was the weapon of Xander Hourath, the strongest mortal to ever live and the founder of the order of the dragonlords.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. 

**Dragonfire Blessing** _"Dragon and rider - when one strikes, the other follows."_
This weapon deals an additional 2d6 fire damage on hit and when you roll a 20 on an attack roll, each other creature within 5 feet of the target takes 1d6 fire damage.

**Wrath of the First** **(1/day)** _"I am the storm that breaks upon titan shores."_
As an action you can channel the power of your oathsworn dragon, unleashing a 30-foot cone of destructive energy. Creatures in the area make a DC 16 Dexterity save, taking 8d6 damage (half on success).

In The Eldritch Hunt, the traditional "Inspiration" and "Legendary Actions" mechanics are replaced by the **Hope & Fear System**—a dual currency representing humanity's flickering light against encroaching darkness.

## Gaining Hope & Fear
Hope & Fear tokens are gained in three ways:

### 1. Through Roleplay
- **Hope**: Acting as beacons of hope, showing compassion and empathy, protecting innocents, maintaining humanity
- **Fear**: Embracing the darkness, acting cruelly, abandoning moral principles, giving in to madness and corruption

### 2. Pivotal Moments
For death saves and when the DM calls for it during crucial scenes, make a **Duality Roll**:
- Roll 2d10 simultaneously (one white for Hope, one black for Fear) instead of the usual d20
- The higher die determines the additional effect:
  - **Hope wins**: Party gains 1 Hope
  - **Fear wins**: GM gains 1 Fear

### 3. Eldritch Presence
Resting outside of a "Safe Zone" generates Fear.
Some creatures (Such as Legendary ones) generate Fear automatically at the start of their turn for as long as they are alive.

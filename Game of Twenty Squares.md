The _Game of Twenty Squares_ is more commonly known as "The Royal Game."The game is considered to be sacred, and it has been played by gods and mortals since the dawn of time. Kings sometimes use the game to resolve disputes that would otherwise result in war.

The game requires two players, and it is played by moving seven pieces across a board comprising twenty squares. Dice are rolled to determine how quickly the pieces can move, and the object of the game is to reach the end of the twenty-square course before your opponent. This requires a mix of strategy and luck. The game is protected against magical interference, which prevents cheating with spells such as mage hand.

### Magical Wagers 
Anything can be wagered on the outcome of the game—wealth, power, magic, or even the lives of the two players. Whenever gods play the game, this wager is enforced by magic woven into the fabric of the multiverse. Depending upon the nature of the wager, as many as six rematches may be allowed.

### Starting the Game 
Two players are required to play the game. They must agree to their wager beforehand, and it is customary to cut the thumb and make a 'blood handshake' before the game begins.

### Winning the Game 
The game is resolved by making a series of seven opposed skill check, which represent the various strategies that can be used to win the game. Each opposed skill check to determines the outcome of a race between two game pieces. The winner of the game is the player who wins at least four rounds, which means that it is possible to win in just four rounds.

### The Seven Rounds
The seven rounds proceed as a series of opposed skill checks. The skill checks are made in this order: Performance, Insight, History, Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Perception. Tied skill checks must be repeated until one player prevails.

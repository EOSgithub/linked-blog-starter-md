Angelo's halo spun excitedly as he arranged his evaluation forms. "Excellent news! It's time for my 90-day performance review!"

"Kid," Grok growled, "your 'supervisor' led us into a demon-infested dungeon yesterday."

_"Celestial team-building exercise,"_ Belfegor whispered to Angelo, _"The demons were volunteer actors from the Department of Moral Education."_

Angelo beamed. "Supervisor Seraiel explains they were just consultants!"

The rogue leaned forward. "Angelo, his name is literally—"

"—an anagram for 'Blessed Forge'!" Angelo interrupted proudly. "B-L-E-S-S-E-D F-O-R-G-E rearranged spells B-E-L-F-E-G-O-R!"

Silence.

_"Yes... that's definitely how anagrams work,"_ Belfegor muttered.

"But he told you to drink poison!" the cleric protested.

_"Immunity training. Very cutting-edge."_

"And to taunt the dragon?"

_"Confidence-building through assertiveness training."_

"Every piece of advice nearly got us killed!"

Angelo's eyes lit up with understanding. "You're absolutely right! He's clearly preparing me for promotion! The escalating difficulty proves he sees executive potential!"

_"Exactly!"_ Belfegor's voice crackled with glee.

Angelo pulled out a fresh form. "Could everyone please rate today's crisis management on a scale of one to ten?"

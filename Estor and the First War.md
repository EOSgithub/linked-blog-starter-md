Of all [[The Dragonlords]], the brothers Telamok and [[Estor Arkelander]] were the most ruthless and savage. Telamok, the elder, dreamed of being a great king. He offered his protection, and that of his dragon, to any who would swear allegiance to him. He promised a future in which the so-called civilized species had utter dominance over [[Thylea]] and the fey creatures.

Mortals of all races flocked to his banner. He built fortresses and walled cities to protect his followers from attack, the foundation of what would one day become the great kingdom of Mytros. The ranks of his armies, under the command of his younger brother Estor, swelled.

For Telamok, war was merely a tool, a way to build and secure the future of his people. Estor, however, cared little for the future. He had no desire to rule or govern, and his only joy was battle. Most, including his dragon, thought he was a brave hero, seeking glory. The truth was far worse, for war was the only way that Estor could satisfy his bloodlust and cruelty. His victories on the battlefield meant nothing beyond the chance of slaughter and carnage.

As Telamok's kingdom grew, it expanded into gygan territory. Knowing the one-eyed, six-armed giants would not welcome outsiders, he commanded Estor to lead his army against them. In Telamok's mind, his brother would break the gygan ranks and force the giants to bend the knee. Estor, however, had other plans.

Riding on his dragon, he led the charge that routed the gygans. The giants fought bravely, but were no match for the Dragonlord and his mount. Once they knew the battle was lost, they threw down their weapons in surrender. Estor refused to take prisoners, and refused to parley. To the horror of his noble dragon mount, he ordered his troops to massacre every single gygan warrior.

The gygan threat was gone, but Estor was not finished. He pushed his soldiers onwards to the towns where the gygans lived. Their warriors slain, the remainder were now defenseless. Estor's dragon begged him to show mercy, but he was deaf to her pleas. His army massacred mothers and children, the old and the infirm. Only a handful of gygans escaped to warn the other fey folk of Estor's atrocities.

The unbridled slaughter revealed Estor's true nature and his dragon abandoned him. The consequences of his actions went much further. Seeing the slaughter, [[Lutheria]] finally recognized the threat the newcomers posed, and she released [[Sydon]] from his vow to not harm them. With his fury finally unleashed, [[Sydon]] gathered a great army of fey creatures and led them against the civilized races that had butchered the gygans. [[Sydon]] meant to drive the invaders into the sea.

The First War had begun.

> _"Listen up, rookie. When I started this whole 'hunter' business, I thought a sharp blade and sharper wit would see me through. Turns out, when you're facing down what we do, you need a bit more oomph. So we learned to take their power—rip it right out of their still-twitching corpses and bind it to steel and bone... It ain’t pretty, but it works. And out here, that's all that matters._

## How the Relic System Works
In this campaign, you don't choose a subclass. 

Instead, you gain abilities by finding and attuning to **Relics**—objects that grant subclass-like features. You will be able to mix and match relics or focus on collecting matching sets for additional bonuses.

The progression of your character will depend on the relics you will acquire through:
- **Exploration:** Discover hidden relics within the fogotten depths of Luyhrna.
- **Combat:** Defeat powerful boss-type foes and make their powers yours. 
- **Quests:** Earn relics as rewards from the five major factions vying for control of the city.

## Character Creation Addendum                      
**Choose a Relic Set** that resonates with your character concept and obtain a **Tier 1 relic** from it during creation.

**Weave it into your backstory**: 
- How did you acquire your first relic? 
- What drives you to complete the set? 

This generates your **Hunter's Journey**—guaranteed story moments where you'll gain relics from your chosen set.

> _**Maria (Pale Monarch Set):** Her husband was frozen into an ice sculpture during the 27th Hunt under the Glacial Moon. She believes these relics can be used to find a way to thaw him._

| Level   | Milestone                 | Guaranteed Reward                     |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **1**   | The First Bond            | Starting Tier 1 relic from chosen set |
| **3**   | Personal Quest: Awakening | Second Tier 1 relic from set          |
| **5**   | Personal Quest: Deepening | First Tier 2 relic from set           |
| **7**   | Faction Recognition       | Access to faction relic merchants     |
| **9**   | Personal Quest: Mastery   | First Tier 3 relic from set           |
| **11**  | City's Acknowledgment     | Any Tier 3 relic of choice            |
| **14+** | Legendary Calling         | Tier 4 relic opportunity              |
_These are minimums. Each proactive hunter finds 3-4 times more relics through exploration and investigation. The grand majority can be found just by playing the campaign and being proactive._

**Levels 9-12:** 8 slots

#### Crown of the Usurper
- **Class Restriction:** Wizard, Warlock or Sorcerer
- **Set:** Pale Monarch - Tier 2
.
- **Seeds of Betrayal:** Creatures that have not yet taken a turn in combat have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and abilities that deal cold damage or impose the charmed or frightened condition. Creatures charmed or frightened by you treat their allies as hostile.
- **Attunement Effect:** Your breath forms soft mist, and food tastes bland. You no longer need to eat or drink — instead, you are sustained by moments of warmth: the laughter of friends around a fire, the radiant light of hope in another's eyes, the glow of kindness offered when none was owed. These moments keep the cold at bay… for now.

#### Pale Monarch - Set Bonus
**2 Pieces:** You gain resistance to cold damage and to the frightened condition.

**3 Pieces:** Once per short rest, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to rise it as an ice thrall under your control for 1 minute (as _animate dead_, but the creature has vulnerability to fire damage and immunity to cold damage).

**4 Pieces:** Your spells and abilities that deal damage can deal cold damage instead of their normal type. When you do so, you ignore resistance to cold damage and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

**5 Pieces:** You gain the ability to cast _cone of cold_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Additionally, creatures frozen solid by your magic or abilities (reduced to 0 hp by cold damage) can be shattered to prevent any form of resurrection.

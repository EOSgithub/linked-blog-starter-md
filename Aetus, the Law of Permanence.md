# First Encounter — Entering the Mithral Forge

>  The elevator creaks and shudders to a halt.
> 
> A rush of hot, metallic air hits you — thick with the acrid tang of ores and ash. Before you, the cavern sprawls, its vastness dominated by rivers of molten stone.
> 
> The glow from the lava dances off ancient gantries, broken bridges, and towering statues of dwarven kings, now cracked and melted into unrecognizable husks of their former selves.
> 
> At the heart of it all, sprawling across a blackened isle in the lava, you see… a **mountain**.

---

> No.
> 
> **A heap of polished mithril ore**. Its surface gleams, like a thousand hammered shields fused into a single, monolithic form.
> 
> Thick ropy chains, swirling with dark runes, bind the massive columns of this unearthly structure to the stone beneath.

---

> For a moment, you mistake it for an ancient relic.
> 
> Then, **an eye opens**.
> 
> A single vast, slitted iris stares at you with **timeless patience**.
> 
> The “mountain” shifts, ever so slightly, and the cavern groans under the weight of its awareness.
> 
> You feel it:  
> **The certainty that you are standing before a true dragon.**


## **Awakening Scene** 🎶
A deep, resonant hum grows from the dragon’s chest, a vibration felt more in your bones than in your ears.

The sound swells and the metal in the cavern begins to **vibrate**.

Then, **the bindings shatter**.

Lava freezes mid-flow. The chains hanging from the forge ceiling twist and calcify into crystalline strands. Your weapons grow heavier in your hands.

**Reality ossifies.**

The dragon rises. It has no wings — only jagged, silvered plates of armor grown from its flesh. Its limbs are **pillars**; its tail, a **sculpture of inevitability**.

> _"Tremble, fleeting ones.  
> I am the Breath of Endings, the Silence after Becoming, the Stone that dreams.  
> All that moves shall still. All that lives shall kneel.  
> I AM THE EARTH UNENDING!"_

What stands before you is not merely a beast — it is **a Law**, written before mortal time.


## **Awakening Ability – "The World Becomes Still"**
**(Environmental Effect - Battlefield Scale)**

- **Terrain Deformation:** Stone erupts in jagged pillars and slabs at random intervals (GM’s discretion — every round, roll a d6 for a new eruption).

- **Gravity Intensifies:** Movement speeds of all creatures (except the dragon) are reduced by 10 ft. Flying creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the start of their turn or fall 30 ft. as if dragged by invisible anchors.

- **Magical Ossification:** Spells that teleport, banish, or displace creatures (like _Misty Step_, _Dimension Door_, _Banishment_, etc.) require a successful Spellcasting Ability Check (DC 18) to succeed.

## **Element Apotheosis – "Permanence"**

- **Mithrill Breath (Recharge 6):** The Mithril Dragon exhales a beam of pure metallic permanence. Creatures hit must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 22) or be **partially petrified**, gaining the Restrained condition until they succeed a Strength saving throw at the end of their turn.

- **Unshakable Carapace:** While in its awakened state, the Mithril Dragon becomes almost invincible to forceful effects. It is Immune to being moved, knocked prone, or restrained and all critical hits against it become normal hits.

# Lair Actions 
#### **Stone Teeth Rise**
> *The mountain rises against those who defy it.*

- A massive **spire of mithril-infused stone** bursts from the ground at a point the dragon chooses within 120 ft. Each creature within 10 ft. must make a **DC 19 Dexterity saving throw** or take **4d10 bludgeoning damage** and be knocked prone, pinned under the stone (Restrained, DC 20 Strength check to escape).
#### **Gravity Crush**
> _You are not meant to stand before the eternal mountain._

- The dragon **increases gravity** in a 30 ft. radius sphere centered on a point it chooses. Each creature inside must succeed on a **DC 19 Strength saving throw** or fall prone and have its speed halved until the end of their next turn.
#### **Unmaking Pulse**
> _Magic finds no grip in the ossified breath of ancient stone._

- The dragon releases a **pulse of permanence**. All **Concentration spells** within 120 ft. must make an immediate **Concentration check (DC 20)** or immediately end.

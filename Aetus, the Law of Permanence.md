# First Encounter â€” Entering the Mithral Forge
 
> The Forge's elevator creaks and shudders to a halt.
> 
> A rush of hot, metallic air greets you â€” thick with the biting tang of molten ore and old ash. Before you, the cavern stretches over rivers of molten stone.
> 
> The glow dances off ancient gantries, broken bridges, and towering statues of dwarven kings now cracked and melted into unrecognizable forms.
> 
> At the heart of it all, sprawling across a blackened isle in the lava, you see... a **mountain**.


> No â€” not a mountain.
> 
> **A pile of polished mithrill ore**. Its surface gleams like a thousand hammered shields fused into a sculpture. 
> 
> Thick ropy chains swirling with dark runes pin the colossal columns of the structure to the stone under it. 
> 
> For a moment, you dare to believe it is simply an ancient relic.
> 
> Until **an eye opens**.
> 
> A single vast iris â€” deep and shining like the molten core of the earth â€” stares at you with **alien, timeless patience**.
> 
> The "mountain" shifts slightly, and the entire cavern groans under the weight of its awareness.
> 
> You feel it:  
> **The certainty that you are prey, standing at the edge of a slumbering god.**

## **Awakening Aria** ðŸŽ¶
> _"Tremble, fleeting ones. 
> I am the Breath of Endings, the Silence after Becoming, the Stone that dreams.
> All that moves shall still. All that lives shall kneel. 
> I AM THE EARTH UNENDING!"_

## **Awakening Ability â€“ "The World Becomes Still"**
**(Environmental Effect - Battlefield Scale)**

- **Terrain Deformation:** Stone erupts in jagged pillars and slabs at random intervals (GMâ€™s discretion â€” every round, roll a d6 for a new eruption).

- **Gravity Intensifies:** Movement speeds of all creatures (except the dragon) are reduced by 10 ft. Flying creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the start of their turn or fall 30 ft. as if dragged by invisible anchors.

- **Magical Ossification:** Spells that teleport, banish, or displace creatures (like _Misty Step_, _Dimension Door_, _Banishment_, etc.) require a successful Spellcasting Ability Check (DC 18) to succeed.

## **Element Apotheosis â€“ "Permanence"**

- **Mithrill Breath (Recharge 6):** The Mithril Dragon exhales a beam of pure metallic permanence. Creatures hit must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 22) or be **partially petrified**, gaining the Restrained condition until they succeed a Strength saving throw at the end of their turn.

- **Unshakable Carapace:** While in its awakened state, the Mithril Dragon becomes almost invincible to forceful effects. It is Immune to being moved, knocked prone, or restrained and all critical hits against it become normal hits.

# Lair Actions 
#### **Stone Teeth Rise**
> *The mountain rises against those who defy it.*

- A massive **spire of mithril-infused stone** bursts from the ground at a point the dragon chooses within 120 ft. Each creature within 10 ft. must make a **DC 19 Dexterity saving throw** or take **4d10 bludgeoning damage** and be knocked prone, pinned under the stone (Restrained, DC 20 Strength check to escape).
#### **Gravity Crush**
> _You are not meant to stand before the eternal mountain._

- The dragon **increases gravity** in a 30 ft. radius sphere centered on a point it chooses. Each creature inside must succeed on a **DC 19 Strength saving throw** or fall prone and have its speed halved until the end of their next turn.
#### **Unmaking Pulse**
> _Magic finds no grip in the ossified breath of ancient stone._

- The dragon releases a **pulse of permanence**. All **Concentration spells** within 120 ft. must make an immediate **Concentration check (DC 20)** or immediately end.

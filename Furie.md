As written in the book, the Furies don’t appear much (unless countless Oaths are broken) and are fairly one-dimensional, with only 1 of them getting an artwork. I have attempted to expand their personalities a bit as well as some potential places they could appear.

**Alecto**, **Megaera**, and **Tisiphone** (LN Erinyes) are called "the Furies," and they are the queens of the erinyes. They gather in the Room of far Sight to discuss how vengeance should be exacted in accordance with the customs and laws of [[Thylea]].

### Megaera, Queen of the Furies
*“In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd.”*
_“Some men are alive simply because it is against the law to kill them”_

Megaeras is a natural leader, charismatic and visionary. She is acknowledged as first among the other Queens because she handles her job quickly and efficiently. The execution of her tasks falls to her sisters or those she considers her ‘underlings’. She rarely engages in any dirty work herself. Being more into scheming, conniving, and underhanded tactics than leading from the front.

Like most immortal beings, Megaera looks upon mortals with contempt and is by far the most brutal of the Furies. When absent from Praxys, Megaera finds herself on the Island of the Oathbreakers, torturing those that have broken serious oaths. Her raw strength rivals that of Alecto, though her illusions and magic fall short compared to Tisiphone.

### Tisiphone, Fury of the Mind
_“Fear powers my illusions. Eating away at you the longer you persist. Once you’re caught, there is no escape.”_
_“My sisters believe my ways to be underhanded. I’m sure they’re just jealous of what I can conjure.”_

Tisiphone is a femme fatale, both seductive and manipulative. She is also very selfish and will do what she can to get what she wants.

Tisiphone is the most cunning and her tricks are crueler than that of her sisters. She also, in all likelihood, has more powerful illusions than her sisters. She was known as the Fury of the Mind, making her able to cast such powerful illusions on her victims. Myth and legend talk of her powerful illusions, and the idea that if you’re caught in one, you’re likely to never escape. You’ve already lost.

Tisiphone possesses a twisted and dark sense of humor with a penchant for violence, unlike her sisters. This twisted side of her makes her play with her victims before taking them to the Island of the Oathbreakers. A fate worse than death.

### Alecto, the Unceasing Anger

_"What's wrong, show your true power.”_
_“You don’t want to make my brother angry.”_

Alecto is the most mysterious of the Furies, her soul being split between two entities. Alecto and her older brother, Harut, represent the anger and destructive power of the Furies, being the most powerful Fury in raw power output.

Alecto was born as a ‘normal’ woman but sacrificed herself as fuel to aid her dying brother. Harut would grow in strength and swear to protect Alecto for as long as she lived. He carries Alecto around on his back, using his raw strength to take down Oathbreakers and bring them to the Island. Alecto uses magic and other supernatural abilities to take down Oathbreakers alongside her Brother.

The two speak to each other in a secret language and confide in each other for every decision. They are trusted and respected amongst the other Furies, but have very little information known about them in [[Thylea]].

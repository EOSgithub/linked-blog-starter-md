1. You see an ent trapped between two boulders. Upon freeing him he grants you all 2 hours of Barkskin.
2. A group of 1d4+2 bandits has set up an ambush on the road. They will attack the players’ party with crossbows and shortbows from the trees.
3. A great elk is seen watching the party from a distance. It almost looks as if the elk is wearing a crown made of twigs and vines. It speaks in an ancient tongue. It offers guidance or a cryptic prophecy to those who show respect.
4. You past through a barren section of the forest that was damaged about a decade ago by a forest fire. In the middle of this relative desolation, you find a circle of trees that seems untouched by fire that destroyed the surroundings.
5. The party finds a scared injured owlbear cub hiding under a large bush. The party can choose to leave it, or keep it and nurse it back to health.
6. A door standing upright in thick bushes completely ignored by nature. If a player opens the door a small cabin interior is found and the faint aroma of cooked meats float out.
7. A party member swears they can hear the crows mumble actual words from time to time. If the party quiets down enough the party member will hear that the words are cardinal directions. If heeded, the crows will continue to guide the party to a giant crow sleeping on a nest of treasure.
8. An emotionally disheveled girl in a red hooded cape offers to sell you a dire wolf pelt for 20 GP or the deed to her deceased grandmother’s cabin for 500 GP.
9. You see a human trapped in a bear trap. Upon release she shifts into bear form and runs away.
10. A group of fairies are seen tormenting a pair of orphaned wolf pups. The party can scare the fairies off easily enough but the pups need someone to look after them.
11. The party approaches a camp of 5 dead kobolds. They seem to have been reaching for their weapons. Strangely, there are no cuts or bruises. If the the party stays there for more than an hour, 1D4 cloakers descend from the trees and assault them. If they stay there overnight, they will be woken up by an attack from 1D8 cloakers as well as a swarm of rats which get killed by the cloakers.
12. You see a dryad summon three 30 ft. spikey, coiled wooden tendrils and just pummel a mimic to death.
13. An incredibly large tortoise is bound in place by ropes apparently put in place by hunters, it looks at the party with sad but remarkably intelligent eyes.
14. Deep in the woods you find a sword lodged in a stone surrounded by thorny vines that drip poison.
15. You find a circle of earth Genasi petrified in worship of a giant, floating, glowing red crystal. Any interference causes the crystal to lash out at you with eldritch red bolts of fire and lightning laced shards. These would make great arrow heads…
16. A ring of glowing mushrooms pulses with magic. Entering the circle transports characters to the Feywild for a brief but transformative encounter.
17. Strange, glowing crystals protrude from the ground. They pulse with magic and may enhance spells or cause unpredictable effects. harvesting them attracts the attention of their elemental guardian.
18. The party stumbles upon a gathering of fey nobles. Navigating their complex social customs can earn powerful allies or deadly enemies.

1. The party comes across a clearing with a strange looking tree in the center. It is a treant.
2. A group of 1d4+2 bandits has set up an ambush on the road. They will attack the players’ party with crossbows and shortbows from the trees.
3. A great elk is seen watching the party from a distance. It almost looks as if the elk is wearing a crown made of twigs and vines.
4. An umber hulk is snacking on a small bear.
5. You past through a barren section of the forest that was damaged about a decade ago by a forest fire. In the middle of this relative desolation, you find a circle of trees that seems untouched by fire that destroyed the surroundings.
6. The party finds a scared injured owlbear cub hiding under a large bush. The party can choose to leave it, or keep it and nurse it back to health.
7. A door standing upright in thick bushes completely ignored by nature. If a player opens the door a small cabin interior is found and the faint aroma of cooked meats float out.
8. A party member swears they can hear the crows mumble actual words from time to time. If the party quiets down enough the party member will hear that the words are cardinal directions. If heeded, the crows will continue to guide the party to a giant crow sleeping on a nest of treasure.
9. An emotionally disheveled girl in a red hooded cape offers to sell you a dire wolf pelt for 20 GP or the deed to her deceased grandmother’s cabin for 500 GP.
10. You see a human trapped in a bear trap. Upon release she shifts into bear form and runs away.

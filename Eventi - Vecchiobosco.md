1. You see an ent trapped between two boulders. Upon freeing him he grants you all 2 hours of Barkskin.
2. A great elk is seen watching the party from a distance. It almost looks as if the elk is wearing a crown made of twigs and vines. It speaks in an ancient tongue. It offers guidance or a cryptic prophecy to those who show respect.
3. You past through a barren section of the forest that was damaged about a decade ago by a forest fire. In the middle of this relative desolation, you find a circle of trees that seems untouched by fire that destroyed the surroundings.
4. The party finds a scared injured owlbear cub hiding under a large bush. The party can choose to leave it, or keep it and nurse it back to health.
5. A door standing upright in thick bushes completely ignored by nature. If a player opens the door a small cabin interior is found and the faint aroma of cooked meats float out.
6. A party member swears they can hear the crows mumble actual words from time to time. If the party quiets down enough the party member will hear that the words are cardinal directions. If heeded, the crows will continue to guide the party to a giant crow sleeping on a nest of treasure.
7. An emotionally disheveled girl in a red hooded cape offers to sell you a dire wolf pelt for 20 GP or the deed to her deceased grandmother’s cabin for 500 GP.
8. You see a human trapped in a bear trap. Upon release she shifts into bear form and runs away.
9. A group of fairies are seen tormenting a pair of orphaned wolf pups. The party can scare the fairies off easily enough but the pups need someone to look after them.
10. You see a dryad summon three 30 ft. spikey, coiled wooden tendrils and just pummel a mimic to death.
11. An incredibly large tortoise is bound in place by ropes apparently put in place by hunters, it looks at the party with sad but remarkably intelligent eyes.
12. Deep in the woods you find a sword lodged in a stone surrounded by thorny vines that drip poison.
13. You find a circle of earth Genasi petrified in worship of a giant, floating, glowing red crystal. Any interference causes the crystal to lash out at you with eldritch red bolts of fire and lightning laced shards. These would make great arrow heads…
14. A ring of glowing mushrooms pulses with magic. Entering the circle transports characters to the Feywild for a brief but transformative encounter.
15. Strange, glowing crystals protrude from the ground. They pulse with magic and may enhance spells or cause unpredictable effects. harvesting them attracts the attention of their elemental guardian.
16. The party stumbles upon a gathering of fey nobles. Navigating their complex social customs can earn powerful allies or deadly enemies.
17. A garden of rare and magical plants tended by an eccentric herbalist who trades potions and remedies for unique items.
18. A suit of living armor that challenges warriors to a duel, offering itself as a reward to those who prove worthy.
19. A dragon infused with the magic of the forest. It can be a powerful ally or a deadly foe, depending on how it is approached.
20. A (giant) eagle swoops in and steals something from the party.
21. You encounter some people seemingly migrating. They're migrating to the nearest city because they lost everything in a massacre by an Aurae. They'll try to sell you things, one of them even tries to sell their daughter's hand in marriage for a handful of gold. They're that desperate to not end up as beggars.
22. Near nightfall a rough and wild looking woman will approach the campsite and ask if she can share the fire. She will offer to share three hunted rabbits with the party in order to secure a place for the night. (She is a Werewolf, but does not want to harm the party. She simply wants some human contact. She does have some weapons, but the rabbits have not been caught with those.)
23. There is smoke coming from somewhere out in the wilderness. (When you go near, the smoke stops but with a successful survival check you can locate a still slightly smoking tree trunk. A successful wisdom check however might reveal it to be a hidden chimney. A secret entrance to an underground lair of illegal brewers is hidden nearby under a large rock that can be pivoted sideways. The moonshiners produce something that is nearly toxic called Dova made with some weird herb. It is strong enough to burn a hole in a normal human’s stomach (as if drinking acid) and is specifically made for dwarves. They say one cup can get a dwarf drunker than a halfling in a keg. The three alchemist brothers will protect their turf at all costs.)
24. There is roaring and thrashing from somewhere off-road. A wounded griffon is trapped in some poachers’ device and her left wing is damaged by some sort of bear claw device connected to a chain. The chain is locked and hammered into a tree stump, next to it lays the carcass of a goat that was probably used to lure her here. (The creature is very wary and will attack any humanoid on sight if it weren’t for her chain radius of 40 ft. Freeing her is not easy as she distrusts everything around her now. This is reinforced the moment someone tries to remove the chain as arrows fly from the shrubbery and the poachers of the Midas Order return for their trophy, this turns the beast hostile again.)
25. You all fall into the natural trap of a large carnivorous plant.
26. A traveler tries desperately to sell you a decent but mundane goat for 50gp. (He refuses to haggle. He looks emaciated. He was secretly cursed for ripping off a witch and can only try to sell this goat. If someone pays for the goat, it and the gold disappear and the man collapses.)
27. You hear beautiful singing, and upon inspection see a beautiful nude woman bathing in a river. (nymph, dryad, or other fey. Will test the character's morality. If they pass, they are given a gift, such as goodberries. If they fail, the fae will attempt to drown them.)
28. A group of druids (followers of Akonus the primordial hydra) watch the party from a good distance away. If approached, they will ask about who the party is, but reveal nothing about themselves. If followed, they prove very patient; they will simply wait until the following party gets bored (or lost) trekking through the wilderness after them.
29. A falling star plummets to earth a good distance away. An Eldritch begin exits from the rock-egg. Ariah intervenes with other lutheria followers to seal it.
30. A construct of some kind (possibly a golem, or something lesser, created by Volkan and given a mission by him) is traveling the other way on the road. Due to its limited sentience, it cannot communicate its goals, but it is not hostile.
31. The party comes across a clear babbling stream, stepping stone crossing, good banks, shallow enough to ford a lightly loaded wagon, and with good fishing too! A nearby druid is somewhat friendly with any travelers passing through with good intentions and a light step upon the land.
32. Whoever is walking in front of the party accidently falls into a pit trap set by hunters to catch a wild boar. Shortly after, some wild boar charged right into the pit.
33. As you travel through a heavily wooded area, you notice that the trees above you are filled with dense spider webs. Hidden amongst the webs are dozens of giant spiders, chittering and watching the party silently in the treetops.
34. An Exiled Sydon Cultist, armed with a greatbow, stands atop an abandoned watchtower near a narrow pass that the party will have to go through if they don't want to waste time. He shouts down at them they must pay his toll or die. Why does he think he can enforce a toll against a party of armed and powerful adventurers? Because he has two tamed Wyverns.
35. As the sun is beginning to set, a ghost of a ghigan appears on the road, and points off into the forest. If the party follows the ghost, it leads them deep into the forest to its long dead village wishing to have its remains put to rest. If the party takes anything from the body, the ghost will attack.
36. They come across a crossroads, as they try and take their first steps across it a horse runs past them, and more follow. All have riders yelling at the top of their lungs. Eventually the crossroads calms down, and a few people traveling behind it inform the players it is a horse-race, and that they are welcome to join in.
37. As you travel past a farmer's field, you see a number of scarecrows above the wheat field, failing at their job as numerous crows sit atop each one. Then one of the scarecrows twitches, sending blood-soaked birds into the sky.
38. An old lady (One of the four winds (the band of Notos)) sits atop a large flat stone at the side of the road, strumming softly on a dulcimer sat upon her lap. As you approach, she asks the party if they can spare her three days worth of rations and water in order for her to reach the nearest town. If they do, she can cast one of the following spells for the party as payment: Scrying, Legend Lore or Locate Creature.
39. Something massive blots out the sun for a moment, but nothing is found in the sky. Moments later, a large carcass crashes beside the road, mostly eaten. It has eaten so it probably won't go after your horses.
40. The party encounters unusual warning signs in an ancient language. When translated the signs seem to say, "This is not a place of honor. We buried something here that was repulsive to us. Leave or die." Investigating further, the party will come to a clearing full of intimidating stone spikes protruding from the ground at odd angles, and a massive black basalt altar in the center. Attempting to dig or disturb the site gives the party radiation poisoning.
41. A crumpled piece of parchment on the trail. There's some writing on it but it's impossible to decipher without picking it up and opening it first. Inside are the words, "Don't read explosive runes!" An acid fireball immediately explodes, centered on the reader.
42. A human young girl with filthy hair, derelict clothes and a backpack too big for her, approaches the party together with her 3 year old brother, who looks equally scruffy. In exchange for protection and food, the girl offers her service as a scout or a helping hand for the party to cook meals, clean and mend things, wash clothes, etc. (The siblings are out and alone for two months now after their village burned down and they lost their parents. The girl has an aura of magic as she is an untamed wild magic sorceress.)
43. Walking towards a bridge, the group sees a troll and next to him two dryads in full armor. As the party approaches, the troll rises with a sigh, uses his big index finger to count the group. He over-counts by one, then reaches into a big bag on his belt and hands out a number of gold coins accordingly. Doing so, he grumbles: “Me never take gold without paying tax again”. The dryads greet you all with a smile.
44. The party comes across a sign that informs them that the path ahead is crawled by smaller medusa and basilisk creatures. As far as they can see there are poles on the side of the road and ropes are knotted to them. According to the sign, everyone should close their eyes and walk along the ropes for the next mile. (A bit further down the road a merry band of bandits awaits all who are dumb enough to believe this.)

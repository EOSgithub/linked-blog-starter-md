I bet you are wondering why I am as mad as hatter. Maybe each human being lives in a unique world, a private world different from those inhabited 
and experienced by all other humans. . . If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn't we really be 
talking about plural realities? And if there are plural realities, are some more true (more real) than others? 
What about the world of a schizophrenic? Maybe it's as real as our world. Maybe we cannot say that we are in touch with reality, and he is not, 
but should instead say, His reality is so different from ours that he can't explain his to us, and we can't explain ours to him. 
The problem, then, is that if subjective worlds are experienced too differently, there occurs a breakdown in communication ... 
and there is the real illness. Not madness, but just a breakdown in communication.

She now finishes her wine bottle, now turned Bloody Mary, in one long several second gulp.

“But the truth is “It is sometimes an appropriate response to this cruel reality to go insane.” And fact, it isn’t me that’s just crazy, 
but no doubt that all women are crazy; it's only a question of degree. And the reason they are all crazy. 
You see heroes, the main reason women are crazy, is that men are stupid. With their vainglorious schemes and shallow ambitions.

Many of them like to argue who is the strongest for instance, like my “son” Yala, like they are from planet strongest, 
and they have something to prove. Some like to conquer land just to say they have it, like my dear husband and brother [[Sydon]]. 
Many like to dominate woman just to say they done it, Like my useless son Talius. They like to kill just to prove that they are capable of 
shoving the pointy ends of things in places where it doesn’t belong, like my mad son Goloron. 
All men really love to do that last one, and all possible ways you can interpret it.”

[[Lutheria]] Then takes the heart, still from beating, all blood wringed from its aorta, and starts eating it, like the world’s second most forbidden apple.
“But that is not why I am mad. Madness is the reason I exist, not to be mad, but to spread madness; for true madness is nothing but a genius mind 
far beyond what lessor minds can understand. To me you are the mad ones at least, by your own definition. 
So, you know what I raise my drinking glass to the ones you call “mad”.

As she stuffs the rest of the heart into her mouth and swallows, she takes the wine glass and jams in in the empty chest cavity of the maenad, 
filling it up completely. She then starts emitting a high-pitched laugh. Intermittingly in-between the laughs she continues to speak. . .

Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. 
They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. 
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race and titan-kind forward. 
And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, 

ARE THE ONES WHO DO.

## Lutheria’s Offer
You heroes are not so bad Afterall. not many people could entertain me for so long as you did. But let’s get down to business! [[Lutheria]] interrupts the first hero that speaks “Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness, and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept everything. So, accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature...Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim.

Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life. So, join me on this mad escapade, live how you want, when you want. Swear an oath of eternal service to me. I am not like other cruel gods. I do not demand religious fervor, abstinence, or for you to forgo the other pleasures in life, I demand the opposite. Give in to your carnal desires! Do this, and I promise I will keep my dominion to the old wood and here in the Nether Sea. But do know the message I preach will have no borders. What say you heroes or was it villains. Honestly, it never really matters”

### Combat Dialogue

#### Phase One (at the start of combat):
You can tell a lot about a woman by her hands, for example if she’s holding a scythe, she’s probably stark raving mad!

#### Phase Three (at around 2/3rds hp):
Don’t be afraid of Death – death is just to blink for an exceptionally long period of time.

#### Phase three (1/3 hp).
I do not fear death. The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.

#### Dying words.
[[Lutheria]] falls don own her knees, blood pouring from the many wounds she sustained. She slowly reaches her arm to the sky, as if trying to reach for something that isn’t there. Her voice becomes less deep and refined, almost like that of a toddler. “Mother, it has been so long since I could remember you clearly. For so long since I have been born of your blessed fruit. Before you shook your mortal coil you said, “follow dads orders, he loves you dearly his most favored child you are”. And I did! I followed every order. I protected this realm from beings of incomprehensible evil. Ancient ones that defy reason, Dragons so large their wing beats created typhoons, sea creatures so vast they dwarf cities. I beat them all mother. Every time I beat one though, they took a part of me and traded it for something far worse. But know I can see clearly again. It’s been so long since I could see. She looks at the hero that slew her, as she weeps tears from all her three eyes and whispers a soft and delicate whisper, inaudible to anyone else “thank you”.


### Aftermath variant
you see [[Lutheria]] slowly petrify into stone as she fades from this world. Behind you; see the three furies. They announce loudly enough for everyone to clearly hear them “greetings heroes, be not afraid. My name is Megara, queen of the furies. We have come to witness the final hours of one who has dedicated everything she was and would have been to the protection of others, even though it can be said she truly died centuries ago. We will bring of what remains to a place of reverence. We also came to deliver a warning, RUN some of the seals were tied to Luthe…………….”

All of the sudden your sense of hearing seems to go. Followed quickly by your sense of touch and smell and taste. Your sight is the only sense still working for you. You see the Nether cubes around you in the distance start to shake. The teraesques Cube remains dormant, however.

One cube starts to open from the bottom. You see what looks like to be a massive snake. It is as wide as the cube, but far longer. It’s as if the cube was bigger on the inside as a giant sea serpent, miles long at least fall from the cube. As the cube is draining. . .

You see another cube, grow an orange hue, as it begins to melt. The waters of the nether sea around the cube seem to evaporate instantly covering the whole area and think blanket of scourging steam. You see an outline of a dragon with a wingspan of over 100 meters beyond the steam.

Finally, you turn around, and see a creature with a dozen tentacles, wider than ancient tree trunks appear looming over the ship, it has the head of a shark with jaws sharp enough to tear through bars of wrought iron. You recognize these three creatures from legends of yore thought to be only myth.

- Scyla, Scourge of Yonder, Slayer of the never-ending vortex of Charybdis
- A sea treader Leviathan known by ancient lore as Jörmungandr, said to be able to grow large enough to encircle the whole world.
- And finally, the massive black dragon, rumored to be able to generate enough heat to evaporate whole lakes known as Ancalagon the Black.

- **Disruption.** Spell attacks have disadvantage against the Flailer.
- **Reflection.** If a spell attack misses Beauty, it reflects the spell back to the caster.

## 🐌 The Hunt for Beauty the Flail Snail
The players are looking to harvest Beauty, a Flail Snail wandering too close to Telamok. Glibnack wants the **Shell Core**, but some _less savory characters_ want it too.

### **Phase 1: The Trail of Beauty**
**Skill Challenge (Optional):** DC 15 Group Check.  
Skills: Survival (tracking mucus), Arcana (analyzing harmonic residue), Nature (identifying its slime), Stealth (approach silently).
- **Success**: Ambush Beauty while it's resting on a ledge, gain Surprise Round.

### **Phase 2: The Battle Begins**
Beauty is engaged mid-feeding on mineral-rich ruins, its shell glowing faintly.

🌀 **Layer Actions** _(1/round, on initiative count 20)_
- **Echoes of the Dead**: 2d4 hostile **Wraith Wisps** (CR 1/4 undead, 1 HP, deal necrotic) swirl through, attacking the closest living thing.
- **Gravitic Distortion**: A mineral node pulses. Each creature in a 30-ft radius must succeed a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled 10 feet toward it.

📦 Environmental Objects
- **Rubble Clusters**: May be pushed down for 2d6 bludgeoning damage, Dex save DC 14 for half.
- **Memento Pillars**: 3 standing stones, can be activated with an Arcana check (DC 15) to emit necrotic bursts (one per stone, 4d6 necrotic, 15-ft cone).

### Phase 3: The Poacher Party
The poachers **wait in hiding**, perched on cliffs, behind boulders, or obscured by underbrush. They're experienced enough to let the adventurers and Beauty **weaken each other**, then swoop in to take what they want.
- A **DC 16 Wisdom (Perception)** or **DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)** check reveals **movement, hushed whispers**, or a **glint of crossbow steel** in the ridgeline.
- If not spotted, the poachers attack **at the end of Round 3** (or after Beauty loses 4 tentacles).

🏴‍☠️ _The Drakestone Poachers_
- **2 Bandit Instigator** - *hardened thugs with beast-bone gear.*
- **1 Priest** - *hooded robe adorned with symbols of Lutheria.*
- 1 **Net Poacher Leader** - *cruel grin and a bandolier of nets coiled across his chest.*

They might say:
> "Lay down your arms, that shell is ours! Anyone else can leave. In pieces, if preferred."
> “Step away from the corpse, or you’ll join it.”
> “Now! Drop the mage first!”
> “Take the big one alive. Could fetch a price as a slave too.”
> “That’s a fine spell. Mind casting it again after I break your fingers?”
> “Nice armor. Would look better on someone who deserves it.”
> “Fall back! Fall back! Shell ain’t worth dying over!”

On Beauty's death, they try to **steal the corpse or flee with parts**.

### Traits
_**Flail Tentacles.**_ Beauty has five flail tentacles. Whenever it takes 10 or more damage from a single source, one tentacle is severed. If all tentacles are lost, it retreats into its shell.

***Shimmering Trail.*** Beauty leaves behind a trail of semi-transparent muck. A creature that enters or ends its turn on the muck must succeed on a DC 14 dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

_**Harmonic Shell Shift.**_ At the start of its turn, Beauty may shift the patterns on its shell, choosing **one** of the following passive effects to gain until the start of its next turn:
- **Illumination.** Aura that blinds creatures within 20ft looking at it.
- **Disruption.** Spell attacks have disadvantage against the Flailer.
- **Reflection.** If a spell attack misses Beauty, it reflects the spell back to the caster.
- **Refraction.** If Beauty succeeds on a saving throw against a spell, each creature within 30 ft. must make a DC 14 Con save or take 1d6 force damage per spell level (half on success).

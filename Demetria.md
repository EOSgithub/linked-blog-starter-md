Recently, teenagers have been disappearing from the towns and farms around Estoria. They are lured into the forest by roving bands of goatlings that serve the mistress of the temple, a dryad named [Demetria](http://localhost:5000/bestiary.html#demetria_arcanumworldsodysseyofthedragonlords).

Demetria has good cause to hate the people of Mytros and Estoria. Centuries ago, the Dragonlord [[Estor Arkelander]] chopped down her sister's oak tree to use as the mast for his ship, the _Ultros_. Demetria went mad with grief for her sister. She swore fealty to [[Lutheria]], who embraced her and further stoked her rage.

You can consider Demetria's hatred was improved recently by [[Lutheria]], fueled because the arrival of the end of the Oath, and kids kidnappings are the start of her Maenad army. The pact she has with [[Lutheria]] might be recent, she was a follower of [[Sydon]] before. She's a result of the recent dispute between [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]].

Demetria’s goal is to snuff out the city of Estoria and demolish [[Estor Arkelander]]’s legacy. Demetria’s plan has a clear through line between stealing the Horn of Balmytria and her final goal: raising a city-destroying treant that will annihilate Estoria, while enacting a ritual that will siphon the souls of all casualties to [[Lutheria]]. 

Regarding [[The Oath of Peace]], [[Lutheria]] can't be held accountable for what her followers might do, she didn't COMMAND Demetria to do any of the stuff here.

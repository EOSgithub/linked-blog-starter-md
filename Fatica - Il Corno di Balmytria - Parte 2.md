#### Phase 4 – A Helping Hand
Now that [[Demetria]] has stolen the body of Prosymeina, the second act of her plan can begin. After the party has completed a labor and return to Estoria, [[Demetria]]/Prosymeina will send a collection of druids and dryads to Estoria. This envoy will entreat [[Pythor]] and Anora, hoping to restore faith between the mortal settlers and the fey of the Oldwood. They are led by Laomedeia, a dryad that was inspired by the heroes’ exploits and wishes to join them while her fellow members of the druids aid Estoria.

This is, of course, a trick. Laomedeia is a devoted sympathizer of [[Demetria]], who hopes to join the party to keep an eye on them and subtly keep them away from [[Demetria]]’s schemes.

##### Roleplaying Laomedeia
Laomedeia can have a stat block of whatever fits the power curve of your party (scout, druid, or sister of the vale (BoBH p.18) all work). In theory, she is a very fun companion to have with the party. Kind, sensitive, and motherly, she is a valiant and insightful character. She is, however, certainly open to all sorts of amorous interactions with the party, even going so far as to initiate forwardly. She is, after all, a [[Nymph]], and she knows her charms will ingratiate her to the party if they are open to such relationships. 

Laomedeia will genuinely work to aid the party in their goals and will show close to zero signs of being a traitor, even when the party fights servants of [[Lutheria]]. She knows that [[Demetria]]’s ultimate goal overshadows most day-to-day actions by the party. Laomedeia is visibly uncomfortable in urban environments, especially in Mytros. Still, she presents a character trying her best to learn and grow into these “alternate lifestyles.” She also chafes at any assertion that the old Dragonlords were glorious heroes. If an insightful party member picks up on this, Laomedeia deflects with the understanding that although the old Dragonlords had a controversial life from the perspective of the fey, the party may well do better. 

What you choose to do with Laomedeia depends on how you like to DM and how your party receives her. If she is treated well by them, perhaps she will grow attached to them and try to save them from fighting and losing to [[Demetria]]. If she has little reason to suspect that the party will improve on the previous Dragonlords, she will turn on them the moment [[Demetria]]’s plans allow for it.

##### Using the Druids of the Oldwood
Technically, the druids and “Prosymeina” are now allies of the players. Depending on how much you plan to integrate this plotline into the main story, you could make the Heart of the Oldwood an entire quest hub, or perhaps the druids’ new base of operations in Estoria. Knowing a bunch of druids can certainly come in handy, and having more repetitive contact with [[Demetria]] can show several signs that the oldwood druids are turning to more suspicious behavior:
- Herkus and other familiar druids eventually disappear, “away on sojourns.”
- More awakened trees are roaming the Oldwood, and though they are non-violent they seem irritable toward outsiders.
- Faun and maenad conclaves keep popping up in the Oldwood, and for every one the druids deal with, two more seem to take its place.
- No matter how suspicious the players become, “Prosymeina” and Laomedeia never seem to be too bothered. Peace is a process, after all.


#### Phase 5 – The Decay of Estoria
Through her agents in Estoria, [[Demetria]] will deliver two oaken pendants to Anora and her betrothed, Stesanor (see below). The pendants will give Anora and Stesanor supernatural health and vitality, allowing them to sleep half as much, take on divine charisma, be able to speak with and control plants, and act as sending stones to [[Demetria]]. These pendants also provide a dull euphoria that will make their wearers less suspicious and more suggestible, especially by [[Demetria]].

Eventually, the two will be persuaded by [[Demetria]] to disband the bulk of the Estorian hoplites. After all, they now have the druids of the Oldwood to protect them. Worship of [[Thylea]] has skyrocketed, but in all honesty it’s worship to Prosymeina (and [[Demetria]]). Additionally, more and more farms in the countryside have had to be shut down due to rigid rules set by the druids, and enforced by Anora and Stesanor. In the wake of this, food grown in the Oldwood has been ferried to Estoria, as it has been grown “more sustainably.” Anora and Stesanor have not opposed these changes, and instead seem to have less and less interest in running their kingdom.

##### Stesanor
Stesanor is a noble character I pulled out of my ass when my players wanted to talk to one of [[Pythor]]’s advisors. He is a young and forward-thinking noble of Estoria, who encouraged my players to think outside the box during Anora’s sacrifice to [[Sydon]]. They took a liking to him, and nobody in the party romanced Anora, so I decided he would be a fitting king-to-be for the Queen of Estoria.

That said, if anyone in the party is connected to Anora, you should feel free to mess about with options:
- Make Stesanor a love rival that only has sway over Anora because of [[Demetria]]’s scheming.
- Make Stesanor a political ally of Anora’s, a fellow idealist who isn’t prone to the back-stabbing of nobles. Have him be a red herring, seeming like he’s behind all the bad changes to Estoria when in fact he’s just another victim.
- Remove Stesanor entirely and just have one oaken pendant.

##### Involving the Players
In this phase of the adventure, the party should recognize that not all is well in Estoria. The completion of their third labor or their reclaiming of the Ultros is a great opportunity for them to come back to Estoria and see how much has changed. If they do not return naturally, that’s fine. Perhaps Loreus and/or Corrina misses home, if they are traveling companions. Laomedeia may try to keep the players away, but she probably can’t keep them out of the city forever.

If the party isn’t taking the hint, you can try to hook them in other ways:
- A druid of the envoy (perhaps a returned Herkus), who is not in on the scheme, has become convinced of wrongdoing by the order and begs the heroes to uncover the truth.
- Anora, in a moment of lucidity, realizes something is terribly wrong but doesn’t know who she can trust. She has the party investigate.

Regardless of how the party tries to proceed, the villains of this phase are the druids and dryads [[Demetria]] swayed to her side. The party should aim to clear the Oldwood druids’ influence from the city, potentially taking on sisters of the vale (BoBH p. 19), duskthorn dryads, [[Centaur]] druids, druids, evil druids (statted as golgari shamans from Guildmaster’s Guide to Ravnica), and even a spriggan (BoBH p. 19) or two. A final fight involving Laomedeia would really pull at the heartstrings. No matter what the party does, however, they cannot stop [[Demetria]]’s master stroke.


#### Phase 6 – Awaken the Oldwood
Using her connection to the Heart of the Oldwood, [[Demetria]] will animate the Heart itself into a treant of incredible proportions. Using the magic of the Oldwood, she will call out to all the scattered and depraved fey that have been in hiding all along. This is [[Demetria]]’s final gambit: reclaim all of Estoria for nature, using the power of the dryad that so willingly watched as her sister was slain.

##### Running the Siege of Estoria
This should essentially be an open-world dungeon, with the party racing between catastrophe after catastrophe. Think of it like a mini Battle of Mytros. The garrison of Estoria will be depleted and the food grown by the druids will activate, bringing the majority of the populace into a deep slumber. That said, the party won’t be entirely without allies. Feel free to amp up their resources, since at this point [[Demetria]] can match it with equally powerful followers:
- [[Pythor]] has sworn no Oath of Peace against [[Demetria]]. This is a great opportunity to show off [[Pythor]], without making him a broken asset later on. This is HIS city.
- [[Kyrah]], likewise, could be put to work awakening some of the populace with her music. She might be able to grant the players a few soldiers to help them.
- Perhaps [[Acastus]] sends one or two dragonlords to assist in the fight. As bad as he is, [[Acastus]] likely does not wish to see thousands murdered.
- If the party helped free any minotaurs, have them show up to aid in the battle. Likewise for the centaurs whose youths the party rescued in the Mithral Mines.

Basically, if the party helped someone over the course of this adventure and you can justify them being here, do it. This is where all the epic payoff happens, don’t hold back.

##### Running the Battle with Demetria
[[Demetria]] will appear in the fight riding on the back of her giant treant. This will be an epic, but tricky fight to run. I suggest the following setup:
- [[Demetria]] (a verdant sorcery green enchantress (BoBH p.22)) on the back of a gargantuan treant. Treat this area as her lair. The treant itself should be composed of multiple “sections,” each with its own stat block and turn in initiative. The easiest thing would be to have a “body” composed of a treant with 4-6 “limbs” composed of shambling mounds with a 50-foot reach or something silly.
- [[Demetria]] will fight hard here, but she knows the key to her victory lies within the city itself. She will retreat when it looks like the party will defeat her, using her Tree Stride to essentially teleport from her treant to any of her forces that have breached the walls of Estoria.
- When the players eventually beat down the treant, it will begin to reanimate, stitching its wounds back together and coming back stronger than before.
- [[Demetria]] learned her lesson from her sister’s death. The treant is immortal so long as she lives; the party will have to fight [[Demetria]] in the finale to stop it once and for all.
- Use [[Pythor]] and other powerful allies to delay the treant as long as they can; the party has to stop [[Demetria]] in the city.

##### Finale – Symphony of Souls
Just as [[Demetria]]’s behemoth of a treant appears unstoppable, the players will learn of another aspect to her plan. [[Demetria]] intends to convert one final maenad: Anora, who will be forced to consume the flesh of Stesanor to be turned. If [[Demetria]] can make a maenad out of Anora, then all the souls of she ruled will be forfeit to [[Lutheria]], and her pact will be complete.

[[Demetria]] will want the fate of Estoria to be sealed at the monument to their success (the Shrine of [[The Dragonlords]] is a fitting spot). After everything that has transpired, the fight may seem fairly standard, but [[Demetria]] will not run this time. She knows she can only complete her mission if she turns Anora, so she will not give her up.

##### No More Tricks
[[Demetria]] will be accompanied by her remaining druid and fey followers. They will be focused on converting Anora while [[Demetria]] holds the party off, but if you believe the party would annihilate [[Demetria]] then by all means add minions to help. This should feel like a desperate fight, especially if Anora is beloved by the characters. Becoming a maenad is a gruesome, horrible fate. Should Anora be turned into a maenad and assault the players, it will be very dark and emotional. Use your best judgment as to whether this will be a possibility for the fight.

However, once [[Demetria]] is slain, the battle is over. The Heart of the Oldwood will collapse into splinters and petrified wood. The remaining cohorts will flee back to the Oldwood.

There are a lot of options for a dramatic exit speech from [[Demetria]], but all in all the fight will finally be done. The souls of Estoria will be saved, and it is likely [[Thylea]] will be grateful to the party when they visit her tree.

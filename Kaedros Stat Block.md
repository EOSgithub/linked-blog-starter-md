**Golden Shockwave (Recharge 5–6):**  
Kaedros slams the ground. All creatures in a 30ft. cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 4d8 radiant damage and gain 1 stack of **Midas’ Curse**. On a success, they take half damage and no stacks.

Once per turn, Kaedros can deal an additional 2d8 radiant damage on a hit.

## Kaedros, the Gilded Juggernaut (Companion)
**Role:** Ally (Paladin / Midas' Curse / Unstoppable Force)

### Action 1 — Golden Strike
When you make a melee weapon attack, Kaedros empowers it:
- The attack deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage.
- If it hits, the target must succeed on DC 15 Constitution save or gain 1 stack of _Midas' Curse_ (slows by 5 ft per stack).

### Action 2 — Herculean Shove
Once per turn, when you make a Strength (Athletics) check to shove or break an object, Kaedros lends his might:
- You add +5 to the roll.
- On success, objects burst apart as if smashed by herculean strength.
- If used against a creature, the target is also knocked prone if the shove succeeds.

---
### Action 3 — Gilded Protection
As a reaction, Kaedros can intercept an attack within 10 feet:
- You gains +2 AC against that attack.
- If the attack still hits, the attacker gains 1 stack of _Midas' Curse_ (slows by 5 ft per stack).

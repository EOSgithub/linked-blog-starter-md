Each Party member takes a turn choosing a path to take in the maze. This happens in the initiative order established at the start of the maze. There are 4 phases in each turn:
#### 1. Drawing Phase
The DM Draws cards and places them face down in the river until the river has three cards. 
#### 2. Action Phase
One of the Party Members can choose an action from the available actions and use them. Once an action is used, it can not be used again until all other actions are used. 
These actions are global, meaning if one party member uses the STR action, no one else can until all other actions are taken.

| Action & Stat               | Action Effect                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forge A Path (STR)          | Add 2 additional "Right Path" cards to the discard pile from outside the game.                                                            |
| Scout Ahead (DEX)           | Reveal the top card of the deck in addition to a card in the river, choose one.                                                           |
| It's Elementary! (INT)      | Draw 3 cards from the deck, choose 1 and put it on the bottom of the deck. Shuffle the remaining cards and place them on top of the deck. |
| Careful Consideration (WIS) | Reveal 2 cards in the river this turn, choose one.                                                                                        |
| Boost Moral (CHAR)          | Remove a "Dead End" card in the river from the game. Draw a new card from the deck and place it face down in the river.                   |
#### 3. Choosing Phase
The Party Member decides which card they want to flip over. 
The card is flipped over and its effect is resolved. 
#### 4. The Cleanup Phase
Once a card is flipped up, and its effect has resolved, discard all cards except "Dead end" to the discard pile and start a new turn. 
If you run out of cards in the deck, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck.
#### End of Round
A round ends when each party member has taken a turn. 
If there are no actions left to use, the actions unlock and are available again for the next round. 


### Running the Labyrinth
Players roll for initiative when they enter the Labyrinth, this will be used to establish turn order and to lock in combat order if a monster is encountered.

At the start of each round roll D6s and remove action options for the rest of the round until you have (Nr. of Players)-1 available action options.

Every time a player successfully performs an action, mark off on the action table which action they used, denoting that the action cant be used until all other actions have been performed.   

In order to escape the Labyrinth, the party must meet the victory condition. Typically this condition is to reveal 5 Right Path cards.   

If the party reveals a "Monster Card" they gain a point of "Monsters are approaching!" when they have 2 of those points, combat is initiated and the party rolls on the [[Labyrinth Encounter Table]]. Once they defeat that encounter, you remove a monster card in the deck from the game.  

If a Room card is revealed, roll on the [[Labyrinth Rooms Table]] to see which kind of room they find.

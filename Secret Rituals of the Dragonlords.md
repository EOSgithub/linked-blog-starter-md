# Bond of the Dragonlord
*Level 3 Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, M (the oath of the dragonlord must be intoned in the Draconic language, while gold and magic items worth at least 5,000 gp are consumed.)
**Duration:** if a recipient ever breaks the oath of the dragonlords, his partner may end the bond.

You permanently bond with a newly-hatched wyrmling, or with a willing dragon. 
The Dragonlord considers all dragons of the dragon's type to be of his or her bloodline.
You can confer the bond to another recipient who you are touching when you cast the spell.
This spell fails if the recipient or the dragon already has such a bond.

If the bonded dragon dies, the Dragonlord will also die within 24 hours unless the dragon is returned to life. the Dragonlord cannot be raised from the dead unless its bonded dragon is alive.

The easiest way to bond to a dragon is to locate an unhatched dragon egg and spend 3d6 days nurturing it in ideal conditions so that it hatches, for example:
- Copper. The egg must be coated in acid. This can be done with non-magical acid once a day, or by using spells such as [acid splash](http://localhost:5000/spells.html#acid%20splash_phb) once a day.
- Brass. The egg must be kept hot. Hot coals work, or keeping it in a smithy's furnace, as does using spells such as [fire bolt](http://localhost:5000/spells.html#fire%20bolt_phb).
- Bronze. The egg must be exposed to the sky for 12 hours a day or suffused with electricity once a day. The [shocking grasp](http://localhost:5000/spells.html#shocking%20grasp_phb) spell could be used.
- Silver. These eggs must be kept cool and dark. Packing an egg in ice would work, or using a spell such as [ray of frost](http://localhost:5000/spells.html#ray%20of%20frost_phb) once an hour.

The dragon will start as a Wyrmling and will use companion rules.
Wyrmlings cannot be used as mounts until they grow into young dragons. 
A Young dragon has a further 5 stages in which its stats grow and will use custom rules.

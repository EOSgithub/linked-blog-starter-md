### **"The Blooming"** 🌸 (Rank E)

🔹 **Posted By**: Lykaon, a hunter from the guild  
🔹 **Location**: Woodhike Woods 

*"Bodies turn up in the woods all the time—bandits, lost hunters, the usual—but I ain’t never seen one like this. I was gathering herbs near the riverbend when I found him. He was covered in flowers.*

*I thought maybe it was some funeral rite—maybe a dryad had taken pity on the poor soul. But when I looked closer, I realized the flowers weren’t laid on him. They were growing out of him.*

*I ain’t going back out there, but if you’ve got the stomach for it, I need someone to burn the whole thing. Plants shouldn’t grow like that. Not from people."*

🔹 **Reward**: 25 gp, a potion of healing

## **"Missing Cows"** 🐂 _(Rank D)_

🔹 **Posted by**: Thanos, a distressed herdsman  
🔹 **Location**: Fields near the Southern Road

_"I swear by the gods, something's been taking my livestock in the dead of night! I ain't no fool—I've seen the clawed-up dirt like somethin' big just snatched ‘em up. No tracks, no blood, just gone! I ain't got much, but I'll pay what I can if someone figures out what’s happenin’ and puts an end to it!"_

🔹 **Reward**: 50 gp, a fresh wagon of supplies, and a warm meal at the homestead

## **"Deep Below"** 🌊 _(Rank C)_

🔹 **Posted by**: The Fisherman’s Guild  
🔹 **Location**: The Docks of Illos

_"We got a problem, and not the kind that goes away on its own. Boats go out, but not all of ‘em come back. And the ones that do? Well, their crews tell tales of somethin’ stirring beneath the waters—something hungry. The currents ain’t natural, and last week, old Phylios swore he heard laughter just before his skiff got dragged under. We need someone to dive deep and deal with whatever’s lurking below."_

🔹 **Reward**: 150 gp, a pearl amulet from a lost shipwreck, and free passage on guild vessels

## **"The Faceless Man"** 🎭 _(Rank B)_

🔹 **Posted by**: Melina, a frantic noblewoman  
🔹 **Location**: The Noble District of Estoria

_"I saw him again. At the feast, at the market, even outside my window last night. He looks like my father… but my father is gone. And it’s not just me. Others whisper of seeing loved ones long gone, standing on the street corner, watching. Not speaking. Just… watching. Someone must find out what is happening before none of us are who we were."_

🔹 **Reward**: 200 gp, a noble’s favor.

## **"Unchained"** ⛓ _(Rank A)_

🔹 **Posted by**: Kosmo, a reclusive scholar  
🔹 **Location**: An abandoned monastery deep in the hills

_"There are things that should never be disturbed. And yet, someone has. I have studied the monastery’s records—centuries ago, they bound something within those walls, something that should never have seen the light of day again. But the seals are broken, and the mercenaries I hired never returned. The one survivor… well, he won’t stop screaming about chains. Stop this before it spreads."_

🔹 **Reward**: 600 gp, a relic from the monastery vault, and access to Xanthos’ arcane library

## **"The Lost Ship"** ⚓ _(Rank S)_

🔹 **Posted by**: **King Acastus of Mytros, Sovereign of the Great Polis**  
🔹 **Location**: **The Royal Palace, Mytros**

*"I do not want to waste words on trivialities, and neither should you. The Ultros—the legendary vessel of the Dragonlords—has been lost to time, but the sea does not forget. Whispers speak of its presence somewhere in the uncharted waters of the Forgotten Sea, waiting to be reclaimed.*

*This is not a task for the faint of heart. If you believe yourself capable, I will grant you an audience at my palace. But let me be clear—I do not tolerate time-wasters. Accept this mission with the resolve it demands, or do not accept it at all."*

🔹 **Reward**: 8,000 gp, a royal writ of favor, and the ownership of an A-class warship within Mytros' navy (should they forfeit the Ultros).

## **"The Hunt"** 🦀 _(Rank EX)_

🔹 **Posted by**: **Guildmaster Hammund 
🔹 Location: The Hunter’s Guild, Estoria**

*"By the gods, it’s real. After all these years, I knew it wasn’t just a drunken sailor’s tale! I have seen it with my own eyes, and I swear upon my knife—Charix, the Raging Isle, still roams the seas!"*

*"This is not just any hunt. This is war. No single band of hunters will be enough—no, this beast requires an army. I will not see this chance slip through our fingers. If you are reading this, then know that I am calling for the greatest hunters, warriors, and fools with more courage than sense to join me in slaying the greatest quarry of our age.* 

*If you think yourself worthy of such a hunt, come to Estoria. We will plan, we will prepare, and by the time we set sail, we will make history."***

🔹 **Reward**: Fortune, fame, and a place in history books. The spoils of a Calamity are beyond imagining.

## **"Missing Cows"** 🐂 _(Rank D)_

🔹 **Posted by**: Thanos, a distressed herdsman  
🔹 **Location**: Fields near the Southern Road

_"I swear by the gods, something's been taking my livestock in the dead of night! I ain't no fool—I've seen the clawed-up dirt like somethin' big just snatched ‘em up. No tracks, no blood, just gone! I ain't got much, but I'll pay what I can if someone figures out what’s happenin’ and puts an end to it!"_

🔹 **Reward**: 50 gp, a fresh wagon of supplies, and a warm meal at the homestead

## **"Deep Below"** 🌊 _(Rank C)_

🔹 **Posted by**: The Fisherman’s Guild  
🔹 **Location**: The Docks of Illos

_"We got a problem, and not the kind that goes away on its own. Boats go out, but not all of ‘em come back. And the ones that do? Well, their crews tell tales of somethin’ stirring beneath the waters—something hungry. The currents ain’t natural, and last week, old Phylios swore he heard laughter just before his skiff got dragged under. We need someone to dive deep and deal with whatever’s lurking below."_

🔹 **Reward**: 150 gp, a pearl amulet from a lost shipwreck, and free passage on guild vessels

## **"Unchained"** ⛓ _(Rank A)_

🔹 **Posted by**: Kosmo, a reclusive scholar  
🔹 **Location**: An abandoned monastery deep in the hills

_"There are things that should never be disturbed. And yet, someone has. I have studied the monastery’s records—centuries ago, they bound something within those walls, something that should never have seen the light of day again. But the seals are broken, and the mercenaries I hired never returned. The one survivor… well, he won’t stop screaming about chains. Stop this before it spreads."_

🔹 **Reward**: 600 gp, a relic from the monastery vault, and access to Xanthos’ arcane library

## **"The Lost Ship"** ⚓ _(Rank S)_

🔹 **Posted by**: **King Acastus of Mytros, Sovereign of the Great Polis**  
🔹 **Location**: **The Royal Palace, Mytros**

*"I do not want to waste words on trivialities, and neither should you. The Ultros—the legendary vessel of the Dragonlords—has been lost to time, but the sea does not forget. Whispers speak of its presence somewhere in the uncharted waters of the Forgotten Sea, waiting to be reclaimed.*

*This is not a task for the faint of heart. If you believe yourself capable, I will grant you an audience at my palace. But let me be clear—I do not tolerate time-wasters. Accept this mission with the resolve it demands, or do not accept it at all."*

🔹 **Reward**: 8,000 gp, a royal writ of favor, and the ownership of an A-class warship within Mytros' navy (should they forfeit the Ultros).

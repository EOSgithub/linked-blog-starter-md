> **Overwhelming Fist (T1)**
> When you hit with an unarmed strike, you can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

> - **Burying Hands**: Target must make a Strength save or have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. If it fails by 5 or more it is also knocked prone.
> - **Bulldozing Punch**: Push the target 10 feet away or upward. If pushed into an obstacle or another creature, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier. Creatures with a Strength score greater than yours can make a Strength saving throw to resist this effect.

> **Weapons of Ruination (T2)**
> The strength you wield is capable of toppling the arcane rules of the world. Your unarmed strikes and heavy weapon attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity. When you hit a physical barrier created by a spell with an unarmed strike you can make a Strength check and dispel the spell on a success (as per dispel magic).

> - **Stomp**: You cause a quake in a 10-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line. Each creature takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and have disadvantage on its next Strength saving throw before the start of your next turn as it is thrown off balance. (Dexterity save negates).

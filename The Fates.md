We may be tempted to look at the Fates through a modern eye, assuming they are impartial and unswayable because that is how fate is often portrayed in modern fiction, whereas here they are evil hags who have at least a certain level of allegiance to the Titans (Balmytria knew she could not kill the Titans with the Fates on their side, so she tricked them in The Game of the Gods).

---

So, if we instead view them as hags that have an absurd amount of power, happy to form grudges and play with the destinies of mortals for their own cruel amusement, perhaps that would be a more interesting characterisation. They compete with Versi to bend the future to their will. For example, the relationship between The Fates and Versi. Versi sees the future, The Fates weave the future. The Fates want her dead. Perhaps the hags are tired of Versi telling the mortals about their plans ?

Meanwhile, The Vanished One is part of the Versi's vision of the future. Perhaps The Fates saw how she had grown attached to this individual, and decided to hit her where it hurts, incorporating her lover and pet into the only path of destiny that leads to the salvation of Thylea, so even if Versi wins, she loses? The "return to me" part cold be to go back to the temple after the boar, to save her as she knew the heroes of the prophecy would free her from disaster (Heleka). The Vanished One was saved from certain death at Praxis. Her placeholders are Jasena Ventrak (Narsus's rider) and Gregor Huorath (Hezzebal's rider).

Long term wise, the prophecy that [[Versi]] saw on the end of [[Thylea]] is falsely linked to the end of [[The Oath of Peace]], everybody thinks that this is the danger, but in reality the way the characters handle the war and the battle of Mytros killing [[Sydon]] and [[Kentimane]] is how they make an enemy of a maddening [[Lutheria]] that will be the true designer of the end of [[Thylea]] : the Apokalypsis.

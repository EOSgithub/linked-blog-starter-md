Lutheria's instructions were typically helpful: "Wait for the uninvited pest to announce itself."

The green light streaking across the night sky was definitely making an entrance. 

I had a couple hours before impact and absolutely no idea how one ex-bard with abandonment issues was supposed to eliminate whatever was about to crater the Old woods. 

Then I heard voices through the trees and grinned. Four travelers, chatting like they owned the place.

Perfect. Sometimes the best solutions involved other people doing your job for you. Working for a titaness really broadened your perspective on delegation.

I began weaving subtle magic—fallen logs developing sudden opinions about optimal placement, roots deciding certain paths were more fashionable. The kind of manipulation that felt like happy little coincidences.

Getting close enough to assess my future problem-solvers took an hour of professional lurking. When I finally got a good look, I nodded approvingly. Seasoned fighters with expensive gear—exactly the sort who could handle whatever was about to crawl out of space and ruin everyone's evening.

Then the massive goliath turned, and the universe decided to play its favorite game: "Let's Make Aria's Life Complicated."

Oh, wonderful. Just absolutely fantastic.

Phior. The gentle giant from that mountain village I used to escape to when Academy life got suffocating. Still offering woodland creatures his trail rations like some sort of eight-foot-tall fairy godmother.

"There you go, little one," he murmured to a rabbit.

"We're burning daylight," called his tiefling companion impatiently.

So, fate had decided that of all the competent fighters wandering Thylea tonight, I'd stumble across the one person who'd actually cared about me. 

But that green light was getting brighter, which meant I couldn't indulge in existential despair right now. 

Time to be practical. Phior was strong, experienced, clearly knew his way around trouble. He could handle whatever was coming. And really, manipulating him into saving innocent lives was probably the most altruistic thing I'd done since joining Team Titaness.

Look at me, being a hero through creative problem delegation. I was practically a saint.

I guided them toward the hilltop overlooking the impact site.
When the green light blazed overhead like the world's most ominous firework, their conversation died.

Phior tilted his head toward the valley, eyebrows raised. The universal goliath expression for "shall we investigate the obviously dangerous thing?"

"Could be valuable," suggested the minotaur cheerfully. "You might say it's a real gem of an opportunity!"

I had to respect the commitment to terrible wordplay even in potentially dangerous situations.

The soothsayer of Caiphon that unfolded from the wreckage looked just like i imagined. Its tentacles writhed with unsettling enthusiasm while its too-bright flame head tried to make direct contact with everyone's sanity.

Definitely not something you'd want to face alone armed with cantrips and crippling student debt.

But these four? Absolutely magnificent. The dragonblood carved through the creature with professional efficiency, the minotaur struck with stunning blows, the tiefling wove fire spells that actually hurt, and Phior transformed into the world's largest, most determined bear. 

The battle ended surprisingly quickly. When the creature collapsed, I found myself genuinely impressed.

They'd made the fight look like a Tuesday afternoon inconvenience. Definitely the sort of competent professionals Lutheria would want to know about.

Good thing I wasn't planning to tell her.

"Everyone ok?" Phior asked simply.

Mission accomplished with style. I was clearly a strategic mastermind.
Which naturally meant I immediately did something stupid.

The branch that snapped under my foot might as well have been a war drum. Only Phior turned toward the sound.

For a moment, he just stared into the shadows where I was hiding.
Then his eyes went wide.

Recognition hit his face like sunrise, followed immediately by something that looked suspiciously like joy. He took a step forward, one hand extended in that universal gesture of "please don't run away."

Yeah, right.

I turned and bolted through the undergrowth like my life depended on it. 

Behind me, I heard him call something to his companions—probably the goliath equivalent of "give me a minute to catch this extremely stupid person." Then came the sound of heavy footsteps crashing through the forest.

"Aria!" His voice carried through the trees.

Oh good. We were doing names now. That made everything so much easier to ignore.

I put on more speed, using every trick i knew. Bend branches out of the way, command roots to smooth the path, make the very trees lean aside. 

"Wait!" he called, gaining ground despite my magical assistance. 

The word hit harder than it should have. Such a simple request, really. Just stop running and talk to the person who'd always been kind to me. Explain how the cheerful girl who used to visit his home had become someone who manipulated good people into danger for a titaness's amusement.

Surely that would go well.

I stumbled against a tree, breathing hard, and realized my face was wet. When had I started crying? My chest felt like someone had reached in and rearranged all the important bits.

Right. Time for a dramatic exit.

I pulled out Lutheria's emergency crystal, grateful for once that my mistress believed in expensive contingencies.

The rift opened silently behind a thick cluster of trees, just out of his line of sight.

"Aria?" His voice was farther away now, confused. "Where..."

I took one last look through the trees toward where I could hear him searching, caught a glimpse of his massive silhouette moving carefully through the undergrowth. Still looking. Still hoping to help.

"Sorry," I whispered to the empty air, then stepped through the rift.

It deposited me on Lutheria's floating garden with its usual lack of ceremony. I sat there for a while, letting myself have a proper breakdown in private. 

When I finally pulled myself together, I finally walked to Lutheria's audience chamber and gave my report. 

_"Mission accomplished: The threat was eliminated by aggressive local fauna."_

She seemed satisfied with this explanation, stupid bitch.

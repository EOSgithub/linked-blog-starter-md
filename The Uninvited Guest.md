Lutheria's instructions were typically unhelpful: 

*“Go to the Old Woods. There, the star-born wretch shall announce itself. Let that utterance be the tolling of its doom. Cleanse it. Thylea shall suffer no trespass.”*

Right. Thankfully the green light glinting across the night sky was certainly easy to spot. 
Points for style, mysterious space horror.

I had hours before impact and absolutely no idea how one ex-bard with abandonment issues was supposed to eliminate whatever was about to crater the Old Woods. My skill set included witty commentary, emotional damage, and making trees do things. Not exactly "alien extermination" material.

Then I heard voices through the trees. Four travelers, chatting like they owned the place.

Oh, hello solution to my problems. 
Sometimes the best plans involved other people doing your job for you.

I began weaving subtle magic—fallen logs developing sudden opinions about optimal placement, roots deciding certain paths were more fashionable. You know, the kind of manipulation that felt like happy coincidences. I was basically a helpful forest fairy. With ulterior motives. And a titaness for a boss.

Getting close enough to assess my future problem-solvers took an hour of professional lurking.

Seasoned fighters with expensive gear—exactly the sort who could handle whatever was about to crawl out of space and ruin everyone's evening.

Then the massive goliath turned, and the universe decided to play its favorite game: "Let's Make Aria's Life Complicated."

Oh, you have _got_ to be kidding me.

Phior. The gentle giant from that mountain village I used to escape to when Academy life got suffocating. Still offering woodland creatures his trail rations like some eight-foot-tall fairy godmother.

"There you go, little one," he murmured to a rabbit.

Of course he was still doing that. Of course he was still the kindest person in all of Thylea. And of course fate had decided that of all the competent fighters wandering around tonight, I'd stumble across the one person who'd actually cared about me.

But that green light was getting brighter, which meant I couldn't indulge in a proper spiral of self-pity right now. Priorities, Aria.

Fine. Phior was strong, experienced, clearly knew his way around trouble. He could handle whatever was coming. Really, manipulating him into saving innocent lives was probably the most altruistic thing I'd done since joining Team Titaness.

Look at me, being a hero through creative delegation. Lutheria would be so proud. (She wouldn't.)

I guided them toward the hilltop overlooking the impact site. When the green light blazed overhead like the world's pretties jewel, their conversation died.

"Could be valuable," suggested the minotaur cheerfully. "A real gem of an opportunity!"

I had to respect anyone who committed to terrible puns in the face of probable death. That took dedication.

The soothsayer that unfolded from the wreckage looked exactly as advertised—tentacles writhing with disturbing enthusiasm while its flame head tried to make everyone question their life choices. Definitely not something you'd want to face alone armed with cantrips and crippling student debt.

But these four? They made it look like a choreographed dance recital. The dragonblood carved through the creature with professional efficiency—

Wait. _Wait._

When he moved, I caught it—the telltale glint of gold spreading across the skin where his blood splattered. Just for a moment before it receded, but unmistakable if you knew what to look for.

So the cursed one still lived. Huh. Helios had some explaining to do. Last I'd heard, the Sun Dragon's little "gift" to the Midas bloodline was supposed to have died out generations ago. Apparently someone missed a branch on that family tree.

The minotaur's strikes stunned, the tiefling wove fire magic that carried traces of something ancient (and wasn't _that_ interesting), and Phior transformed into the world's most determined bear. Because of course he did.

I wish I could warn them.
But worse was coming, and when our paths crossed again—and they would, for the Fates had already spun that thread, meddlesome crones that they are—I’d have the Deliverer at my side. 

Maybe I'd even get to watch the golden boy's face when he realized what his curse really meant. That would be fun. (It wouldn't. Nothing was fun anymore.)

"Everyone okay?" Phior asked simply.

Mission accomplished with style. I was clearly a strategic mastermind. Which naturally meant I immediately did something spectacularly stupid.

The branch that snapped under my foot might as well have been a dinner gong. _Hey everyone, suspicious person lurking in the bushes!_

Only Phior turned toward the sound. Because of course his hearing was still annoyingly excellent.

Recognition hit his face like sunrise breaking through storm clouds, followed immediately by something that looked suspiciously like joy. He took a step forward, one hand extended in that universal gesture of "please don't run away, I just want to help."

Yeah, that was my cue to leave.

I turned and bolted like my shoes were on fire and my past was chasing me. Which, technically, it was.

"Aria!" His voice carried through the trees.

Oh good, we were doing names now. That made everything so much better. So much easier to ignore when he was using the voice that used to talk me to sleep.

I put on more speed, using every trick in my considerably expanded repertoire. Branches bent aside, roots smoothed my path, trees themselves leaned away. Nature's very own express lane for emotionally compromised ex-bards.

"Wait!" he called, gaining ground despite my magical assistance because apparently being eight feet tall came with proportionally long legs. So unfair.

Such a simple request. Just stop running and talk to the person who'd always been kind to me. Explain how the cheerful girl who used to visit his village had become someone who manipulated good people into danger for a titaness's amusement. I'm sure that conversation would go _swimmingly_.

"Hey Phior, remember me? I'm evil-adjacent now! Want to catch up over tea?"

I stumbled against a tree, breathing hard, and realized my face was wet. When had I started crying?

Right. Time for a dramatic exit before this got even more pathetic.

I pulled out Lutheria's emergency crystal, grateful for once that my mistress believed in expensive contingency plans. The rift opened silently behind a thick cluster of trees, just out of his line of sight.

"Aria?" His voice was farther away now, confused. "Where..."

I caught a glimpse of his massive silhouette moving carefully through the undergrowth. Still looking. Still hoping to help. Still being the good person I'd never deserved to know.

"Sorry," I whispered to the empty air, then stepped through the rift before I could do something truly stupid like stay.

The floating garden received me with its usual lack of ceremony or sympathy. After a proper breakdown in private (because even titaness minions needed their cry time), I walked to Lutheria's audience chamber and gave my report:

_"Mission accomplished. The threat was eliminated by aggressive local fauna."_

She seemed satisfied with this explanation, the stupid bitch. Probably already planning how to use my little discovery about Helios' bloodline. 

Well, let her plot. 
Maybe by the time Mytros burned, I'd have made up my mind on how to free myself.

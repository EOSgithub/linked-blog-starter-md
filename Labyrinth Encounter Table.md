Whenever one of these encounters is triggered, Graxis, the Butcher will roar loudly, his voice echoing through the numerous corridors of the Tomb of Xander. He is using his Dead Hunter’s Roar feature:

> **Dead Hunter's Roar.** Graxis bellows, even the walls trembling at his rage. Any creature who can hear Graxis must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a creature can hear Graxis but can't see him, they make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature can make a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, possibly ending the effect on itself on a success.

### 1~5: Skeleton Hoplites
The heroes come upon 3 Hoplite Skeletons: 1 Defender, 1 Spearman, and 1 Archer. 

These are former warriors from many factions of ancient Thylea, reanimated by Damon to serve as foot guards in Xander’s Tomb, and are trained in combat. Their formation is simple, limited by the nature of the corridors (which are 5 ft. wide and 10 ft. tall): the defender holds the frontline with his shield and defensive abilities, the spearman attacks from behind him with his pyke, and the archer uses their bows and arrows to attack the party from behind their allies.

### 6~10: Minotaur Skeletons
The heroes are rushed by 2 [Minotaur Skeletons](http://192.168.1.3:5050/bestiary.html#minotaur%20skeleton_xmm), each coming from one side of the corridor, pressing the heroes together. 

--- 
### 10~12: Tomb Guard
The heroes come across a single [Tomb Guard](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/1BPiqQxruIyXi_F3fjhK2L3mL_wXXz4KNwwx8AHLNOu0U), an unnatural, multi-armed skeleton. It fights violently and without tactics: it simply uses its Cascade of Steel and Parrying Flurry features whenever possible.

---
### 13~15: Tomb Dwarf and Guardian
The heroes discover a [Tomb Dwarf](http://192.168.1.3:5050/bestiary.html#tomb%20dwarf_toa), an undead architect of the Necropolis which now roams the maze’s corridors as part of their patrols, accompanied by a [Tomb Guardian](http://192.168.1.3:5050/bestiary.html#tomb%20guardian_toa), a humanoid figure clad in multiple pieces of broken bronze armor stitched together. The dwarf starts off by using its crossbows while keeping their distance, but if the heroes come into melee reach, they change tactics: they will always use one Battle Axe attack and one Life Drain attack. The Guardian rushes the party.

### 16~20: Graxis, the Butcher
The heroes hear a terrible roar, and an enormous, monstrous minotaur appears at the end of the hallway, carrying an old ax and shield. It’s clearly too large for these corridors, but it doesn’t seem to matter: it bends and warps its body as it guns in their direction. [Graxis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x5mdviFGyxZ1-CMpfGDaMfFwyROAv_OL/view?usp=sharing) makes hit-and-run attacks: he uses his Unrelenting Charge feature to run through the party, wounding them, and leaves. If they manage to stop his charge, he disengages as soon as possible, retreating to his lair in order to feast and recover any lost hit points.

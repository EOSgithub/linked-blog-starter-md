The Five Gods were born when the powers of [[Sydon]] and [[Lutheria]] were stolen and infused into the bodies of five dragons who served [[The Dragonlords]]. The dragons surrendered their draconic forms and assumed new humanoid identities as lesser gods. Through the power of their pantheon, they can hear the prayers of their worshippers and grant them the power of magic.

Mytros is the wellspring of their divine power. She ascended to true godhood when she sacrificed herself to forge [[The Oath of Peace]].


## Explaining the Gods
The gods of [[Thylea]] are far more active than the deities of most D&D worlds : they are not heaven-dwelling deities but familiar faces who walk among their people. The gods can assume any form they choose, but they most commonly appear as humanoids or Titans (depending on their pantheon)—the form in which the people of [[Thylea]] most easily imagine them.

They have been known to take mortal husbands and wives, rule over cities, and sire demi-god children. But that doesn’t mean they are ordinary creatures—they aren’t mere mortals, nor are they simple monsters.

The gods of [[Thylea]] aren’t omniscient, though they can see and hear everything that occurs inside their temples and before their altars when they focus their attention there. They have perfect recall of everything they experience. Gods can appear in the dreams of mortals or manipulate natural phenomena to create omens.

The gods of [[Thylea]] aren’t omnipotent. Although they are physically and magically powerful, ageless, and all but immortal, resurrecting at their temple, their actions are bound by the natural cosmic [[Laws of Thylea]], more than anyone else : Oaths are expected to be honored upon the life of the swearer, and guests can be expected to be shown hospitality even in the homes of their fiercest enemies.

It is believed that the idea of the existence of gods, as it grew in popularity among the people of [[Thylea]], didn’t bring the gods into being by itself. Something, probably reverence and worship, turned universal ideas into divine sparks, brought from the dream-substance of Nyx. And those divine sparks were fused with [[Thylea]]'s childs and champions, who became deities.

Gods need dedication, sacrifices and prayers to fuel their divine spark, and grant their clerics the ability to cast spells. Worship remains crucial to the power of the gods, though mortals are generally not aware of their influence. Were a god to cease being worshiped, their might would dwindle.

They can effortlessly duplicate the effect of any spell they could grant (any domain spell from their domains). They also have broad influence over aspects of the world associated with their portfolios, beyond what can be defined by spell effects. For example, [[Sydon]] can call up a storm or a drought. Gods can bestow supernatural blessings on mortals, and they can lay terrible curses. They can also create Nyxborn creatures to serve as messengers or emissaries.

When physically present in the mortal world, the power of the gods exceeds that of any mortal being. But a god is not capable of devastating physical attacks like those presented in Mythic Odyssey of Theros (Heliod’s spear striking the polis of Olantin caused it to sink forever into the sea, and an errant blow from Purphoros’s hammer shaped the mountains).

In rare cases, Gods can ascend to Nyx where any direct interaction between the gods and the mortal world becomes impossible. There, they often seem to be walking across the dome of the sky, with their feet disappearing just below the horizon. Any part of a god’s body that isn’t directly lit takes on the appearance of the starry night sky of Nyx.


## Status Quo
They can not attack the Titans or their followers or even ask their followers to do that, and they can't deny the Titan's right of appeasement.

They know their age is coming to an end, but can't say so.

The gods have different reactions to the situation, which you must understand to roleplay them correctly :
- [[Vallus]] guides the settlers with her wisdom and the support of ascended Mytros, trying to mix the different cultures, and works for peace, marrying [[Acastus]] and inviting Chondrus and [[Gaius]] to the city's council.
- Pytor tried to be helpful : he participated in the first war, in the Aresian wars, became King to overthrow a tyrant. But Hexia punishes him for being a womanizer and leaving his dragon life, and his portfolio being blocked by [[The Oath of Peace]] he's depressed.
- [[Volkan]] mourns his wife and the loss of the forge, and isn't that interested in the settlers agenda. A spark of interest will be seen when PCs look for the Forge, or when they speak of Mytros, or of Balmytria.
- [[Kyrah]] played music in the 4 winds band, she profited from her godhood knowing it will disappear. But, morale boosted by [[Versi]]'s visions she made a cunning plan. [[Kyrah]] now plays around the oaths posing as a music teacher with the god's name.

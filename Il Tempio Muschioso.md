Deep within the Oldwoods lies a ruined temple complex covered in a thick layer of moss and surrounded by massive trees. No one knows who built the temple, but the Druids of Oldwood believe that it is the oldest structure in the Heartlands. They maintain a circle of standing stones nearby, hoping to appease the spirits that haunt the temple. None who enter the temple have ever returned.

## The History of the Temple
The temple's true name is lost to history. It was built thousands of years ago by an ancient race of six-armed cyclops called the gygans. It honors Sydon, and it harkens to a time long before the mortal races arrived in Thylea. During this period, the gygans were devout servants of the Titans. They propitiated Sydon with great sacrifices, earned his favor, and their empire spanned all the islands of Thylea. The gygans were thought to have been exterminated by Pythor and the Dragonlords by the end of the First War.

## Demetria, the Vengeful Dryad
Recently, teenagers have been disappearing from the towns and farms around Estoria. They are lured into the forest by roving bands of goatlings that serve the mistress of the temple, a dryad named [Demetria](http://localhost:5000/bestiary.html#demetria_arcanumworldsodysseyofthedragonlords).

Demetria has good cause to hate the people of Mytros and Estoria. Centuries ago, the Dragonlord Estor Arkelander chopped down her sister's oak tree to use as the mast for his ship, the _Ultros_. Demetria went mad with grief for her sister. She swore fealty to Lutheria, who embraced her and further stoked her rage.

Demetria loathes mortals. She captures young men and women to serve in Lutheria's dark rituals, telling them that they are being initiated into an ancient priesthood. In actuality, the women are transformed into monstrous [maenads](http://localhost:5000/bestiary.html#maenad_arcanumworldsodysseyofthedragonlords), while the men are slaughtered and devoured in ritual feasts.

You can consider Demetria's hatred was improved recently by Lutheria, fueled because the arrival of the end of the Oath, and kids kidnappings are the start of her Maenad army. The pact she has with Lutheria might be recent, she was a follower of Sydon before. She's a result of the recent dispute between Sydon and Lutheria.

In the past year, Demetria has become more brazen. She has captured dozens of teenagers now. Recently, she sent her goatlings to steal the [Horn of Balmytria](http://localhost:5000/items.html#horn%20of%20balmytria_arcanumworldsodysseyofthedragonlords).

Demetria’s goal is to snuff out the city of Estoria and demolish Estor Arkelander’s legacy. Demetria’s plan has a clear through line between stealing the Horn of Balmytria and her final goal: raising a city-destroying treant that will annihilate Estoria, while enacting a ritual that will siphon the souls of all casualties to Lutheria. 

Regarding the Oath of Peace, Lutheria can't be held accountable for what her followers might do, she didn't COMMAND Demetria to do any of the stuff here.

## Quest: The Horn of Balmytria
The horn of Balmytria has been stolen from the Dragon Shrine by someone. They've carried it south from Estoria into the Oldwoods, and they haven't been very careful. The trail is marked by haphazard splashes of red wine which run all the way through the forest.

# ADDITIONS

### Mossy Temple
Herkus is important to help characters understand there is human meat at the dining table. Even if the pcs don´t interact, he can follow and manifest himself there. As written the girls attack Demetria if someone mentions their food is human meat, i had them simply flee under the table in terror.

#### Corinna and the Goatlings
Even if she was charmed when entering the temple, and ran going away, Corinna should remember some things about it : consider she was sleeping in the glade when Laureus shook her to go away.

#### Estor's shield
You could make Estor's shield a broken +1 shield, 2 days reparation needed & 40 gp at the forge.

#### Negociating with Demetria
It is also possible your group wants to negociate, despite the kids's cooking. One of my group understood the dark ritual process, but agreed to the oath of friendship, and proceeded removing the children from the table while talking. Good persuasion check(s) & accepting hospitality, maybe drinking wine (and leave the horn after drinking from it ?), Demetria can promise stopping building a Maenad army with her dark ritual in exchange of a promise from the heroes to come back with her sister's tree from the Ultros before the end of the oath, which would allow her resurrection.

> Demetria: "If your words are more than poisonous wind, prove it. Swear an oath to the gods and the fates here and now that you will do everything in your power to return my sister to me, and i will swear an oath that i will stop my dark rituals and abductions until the end of the oath of peace".

But Demetria's sister is something they won't know is also very important for them (drinking from the horn might already make them feel they made a mistake, as they need it for their odyssey and they can't afford dismantling it), so they might have to come back to Demetria to renegociate her bargain (for example trade that promise against the promise to kill Estor when they find his haunt AND to bring the sister back after The Ultros is of no use anymore). If so, a vision from Versi can tell the following augury : "never will he taste death by another's blade". They could also get a new mast blessed by Thylea in the golden heart or something?

### Demetria's subplot greatly enhanced (Kuann)
This version takes Demetria’s static plan (slowly gather humans and convert them into maenads… forever I guess) and replaces it with a grand scheme that will culminate in the destruction of Estoria and the committal of every soul in it to Lutheria. Throughout it, your players will have many chances to engage with Demetria’s schemes, culminating in a final battle for the sake of Estoria’s souls.

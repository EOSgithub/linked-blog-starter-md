The temple's true name is lost to history. It was built thousands of years ago by an ancient race of six-armed cyclops called the gygans. It honors [[Sydon]], and it harkens to a time long before the mortal races arrived in [[Thylea]]. During this period, the gygans were devout servants of the Titans. They propitiated [[Sydon]] with great sacrifices, earned his favor, and their empire spanned all the islands of [[Thylea]]. The gygans were thought to have been exterminated by [[Pythor]] and [[The Dragonlords]] by the end of the First War.

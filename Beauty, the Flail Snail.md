### Traits
_**Flail Tentacles.**_ The Flailer has five flail tentacles. Whenever it takes 10 or more damage from a single source, one tentacle is severed. If all tentacles are lost, it retreats into its shell and wails.

_**Harmonic Shell Shift.**_ At the start of its turn, the Flailer may shift the patterns on its shell, choosing **one** of the following effects until the start of its next turn:
- **Illumination.** Blinds creatures within 20ft.
- **Disruption.** Spell attacks have disadvantage against the Flailer.
- **Reflection.** If a spell attack misses the Flailer, it reflects the spell back to the caster (only once per turn).
- **Refraction.** If the Flailer succeeds on a saving throw against a spell, each creature within 30 ft. must make a DC 15 Con save or take 1d6 force damage per spell level (half on success).
- **Levitation.** It gains a flying speed of 20 ft. (hover)

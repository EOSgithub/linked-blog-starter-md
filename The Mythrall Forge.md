If the Forge at the Mithral Mines is reawakened by the Forgekeeper salamander, it can be used by [[Volkan]] to create new magical items, as long as the necessary components are brought to him.

## Mithral Forge Recipes
The following table lists items that may be crafted at the Mithral Forge. Feel free to add secondary ingredients if you wish to give your players an additional challenge in collecting materials. For example, winged boots might also require feathers or blood from at least one type of fantastical flying creature (bird feathers or blood would not suffice).

## Crafting Other Items
You may also allow the heroes to use the Mithral Forge to craft magic items using the normal creation costs and minimum levels (see [Game Master's Guide](http://localhost:5000/book.html#DMG) pg. 129).

The forge accelerates the rate at which such items may be crafted, without increasing the overall cost. Use the table below to determine the rate at which items may be crafted. Once an item has been successfully crafted in this way, the forge must be allowed to rest for one week.

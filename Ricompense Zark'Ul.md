### Major Relic – Heart of Æ
_Artefatto, unico (requires attunement by replacing your own heart)_

Forged with the heart of the axis of permanence, still pulsing with liquid mithril and geometric resonances.

Effects:
- You acquire the **dragon** type in addition to your other types.
- You can choose to ignore conditions that would alter your form, movement or time, and, if you do, the creature that imposed the condition takes 1d4 force damage.
- Each time you suffer a critical hit, roll 1d4. With a 3 or 4, the attack is not a critical.

### Claws of Æ
*Natural Weapons, rare (requires attunement by a monk)*

A pair of fossilized dragon claws, turned into magical gauntlets or grafted weapons.

**Effects:**
- If you hit the same creature twice in one turn with these claws it begins **bleeding** (1d4).
- **Sunder the Unnatural (1/long rest):** The claws can disrupt magical constructs. As an action, you may rake them across a magical surface or seal. This counts as casting _dispel magic_ at 3rd level.

### Teeth of Æ 
_Weapon (any slashing or piercing weapon), rare (requires attunement)_ 

Forged from Æ’s teeth, this weapon channels still draconic might.

**Effects:**
- +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
- Evolving: This weapon gains additional properties at levels 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17.
	- **Slumbering:** Whenever you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this weapon, each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target takes 5 force damage.
	- **Stirring:** The weapon deals an extra **1d6 force damage** on a hit.

### Scale of Æ
_Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a druid)_

Forged from a single glistening scale of the Mithril Dragon that once coiled at the roots of the world. 

Effects:
- **Dragon Form.** As part of your Wild Shape feature, you may transform into a **Mithril Dragon Wyrmling**. This form counts as a CR 2 beast for the purpose of Wild Shape and does not count against your known forms. 

- **Reject Entropy (1/Long Rest).** As a bonus action, you may use the scale to end **one ongoing effect** on yourself that has a **duration**. The effect ends instantly, **as if rejected by reality itself**. This ability functions even against effects that normally can’t be dispelled or require specific conditions to end.

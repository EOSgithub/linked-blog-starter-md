# Bond of the Dragonlord
*Level 3 Enchantment*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, M (the oath of the dragonlord must be intoned in the Draconic language, while gold and magic items worth at least 5,000 gp are consumed.)
**Duration:** if a recipient ever breaks the oath of the dragonlords, his partner may end the bond.

You permanently bond with a newly-hatched wyrmling, or with a willing dragon. 
The Dragonlord considers all dragons of the dragon's type to be of his or her bloodline.
You can confer the bond to another recipient who you are touching when you cast the spell.
This spell fails if the recipient or the dragon already has such a bond.

If the bonded dragon dies, the Dragonlord will also die within 24 hours unless the dragon is returned to life. the Dragonlord cannot be raised from the dead unless its bonded dragon is alive.

---

This requires you to locate an unhatched dragon egg and spend 1d4 days nurturing the egg so that it hatches.

Wyrmlings cannot be used as mounts until they grow into young dragons. 
A dragon cannot use legendary actions while it is being used as a mount.

**Controlling a Young Dragon:** Your dragon moves and acts on your initiative. You can decide how the dragon moves and attacks. While your dragon is fighting alongside you, it loses its multiattack feature. If your dragon has a breath weapon, it can be used once, and it recharges after you and the dragon complete a long rest.

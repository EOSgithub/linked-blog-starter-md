Kids of [[Sydon]], and [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]] aren't that developed.
Use Young Epyreal stats, and add a few extra glamoury spells and abilities to all.

### Talieus, young Titan of Beauty
Described as very handsome, is proud and a braggart : use the Trickery statblock. He's a spoilt playboy, like Narsus but more cruel. Chalcia, Yala and Hergeron are dismissive of Talieus, who thinks he is the best but is too proud to notice they only really humour him, don't listen to his input and slag him off behind his back.

[[Sydon]] plans to give him [[Kyrah]]'s trickery domain after the war.

### Hergeron, young Titan of Craft
At ease with words and a cunning planner, he also is a crafter. [[Sydon]] plans to give him [[Volkan]]'s sun portfolio after the war. He's all about the numbers and planning : use the Sun statblock because forge.

He oversees the Games at Mytros for the Praxis team.

### Goloron, young Titan of Swiftness
Mad, the only encounter is him off at sea surveying : use the Tempest statblock. He's the black sheep, the reason he's sent out to survey the seas is because he's kinda mad like his mother. He's [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]]'s favourite though. May have him make some comments if the party meets him about how he's the only one that understands her suffering, the poisoning of her mind in her shielding against the Far Realm, etc. None of them like Goloron or even invite him to the throne room for meetings/planning

### Yala, young Titan of Strength
Born a fighter, [[Sydon]] plans to give her [[Pythor]]'s War portfolio after the coming war. She has been a patron of the Amazons, before [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]]'s coup at Themis. She's the most straightforward one : use War statblock.

She oversees the Games at Mytros for the Praxis team.

### Chalcia, young Titan of Wisdom
She's chosen to be [[Sydon]]'s successor. Mix Knowledge & War & Tempest statblock. She's the clear favourite and most well-rounded. Chalcia respects only Yala and Hergeron.

### Their relationships:
Yala and Hergeron being kind of mirrors of one another- the warrior and the planner, the 'barbaric' one and the 'cultured' one - Yala patron of the Amazons, Hergeron patron of the Order of [[Sydon]] and the Jancans. Planned to be advisors to Chalcia in her position as [[Sydon]]'s Heir, and the only two that actually had any contention to be heir instead of Chalcia.

Yala and Hergeron have (like their parents), a love/hate relationship in which they often argue in court and then are going at it like rabbits behind closed doors. They both respect and are (not very secretly) jealous of Chalcia.

## Delphia's kids
[[Sydon]] had childs with the dryad Delphia. Those are :

- [[Versi]] (see Temple of the Oracle & NPC section).
- Demetria (see Mossy Temple).
- A third unnamed dryad who was killed by [[The Dragonlords]] who took her tree to make the Ultros's mast, which i called Ultraia, and i had her haunt the ship.

## Helios
raw Helios is represented as a radiant, golden-haired man who poses as a sungod. I made him a true god. His portfolio is the domain of light, coming from the sun : as [[Thylea]] is a demi-plane, he is charged of crossing the sky every day aboard his chariot of dawn, to bring sun to [[Thylea]].

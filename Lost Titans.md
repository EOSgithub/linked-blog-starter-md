The Lost Titans quest belongs to the new Timeless One Epic Path, but can also be accomplished if noone takes that Epic Path, if your group is so interested : [[Sydon]]'s old enemies should interest your PCs.

### Finding and Freeing the Lost Titans
Finding the Lost Titans is one thing - freeing them is another. The module suggests the use of the Wish spell (this comes from a luck blade, the Praxys Vault or the white stag in the Heavens), however alternatives are provided here:

#### Chalcia, Titan of Swiftness, Fire Island
Freeing Chalcia is a matter of stopping the sacrifices on Fire Island. Once a day has passed without a sacrifice on the island, [[Sydon]]’s seal will become visible, and the day after a pair of [[Kentimane]]'s arms appear and sink low enough to rip a hole big enough for Chalcia to escape.

This should be a dramatic moment. She might be mad or not. The Timeless One will hear their mother’s voice and receive a vision of themselves giving this solution, but if you have none you should use the "Chacia controls [[Kyrah]]" variant.

#### Talieus, Mad Titan of Craft, Hypnos
Saving Talieus requires defeating [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]], followed by using his sword, Titansbane, to free him from bondage.

#### Petrified Titans, Titan Island
- Yala, Titan of Beauty
- Goloron, Titan of Wisdom
- [[Versi]], Mad Titan of Prophecy

Freeing [[Versi]] (partially petrified) and the others on Titan Island requires the combined use of the Staff of [[Kentimane]] (or Pytor's Hammer) and Titansbane. Combined, the two tools can be used to ‘chisel’ the stone off of the Lost Titans. A single swing upon each Titan causes the stone to fall off of their bodies in hundreds of falling pieces. In my games, Ultros had to leave the Nether to get the hammer back from [[Volkan]] through Keledone Air Service.

#### Hergeron, Mad Titan of Strength, Praxys
Hergeron can be freed by using the Staff of [[Kentimane]] if you have a Timeless One (she will receive another vision from their mother). By stamping it upon the adamantine spikes the character summons a series of the Hands of [[Kentimane]] to free Hergeron and to hold up the tower in Hergeron’s place.

Alternatively, releasing the star destroys the tower, so you could have it not killing Hergeron when released but destroying the tower around him. He digs himself out of the rubble but is still insane (OktOblivion).

### What Becomes of the Lost Titans?
Some Titans are mad from their time being prisoner. Curing them requires a wish spell or maybe a fruit of the golden heart. They all lost their divine spark, stolen by [[Sydon]].

The Lost Titans each represent a powerful potential ally. For example, Hergeron is statted as an Elder Empyrean (CR 21). It is possible that, if they are freed in time, the Lost Titans will aid them in the Battle of Mystros. If this occurs, the number of turns it will take [[Kentimane]] to destroy the city is doubled, and the Lost Titans can buy the party more time to heal/rest during the battle before confronting [[Sydon]] or [[Kentimane]].

Alternatively, the Titans may depart [[Thylea]], or fade away from existence after having bestowed a portion of themselves into the Timeless One. This could make for several heart-breaking scenes, especially when it comes to the Timeless One’s mother. This could also happen after the Battle of Mytros.

If the Lost Titans survive the Battle of Mystros and are still present in [[Thylea]], they retire to their mother’s golden island to live in peace and solitude as they recover from their eons of torment.

#### But What About the Madness?
Following the communion with [[Thylea]], have the Mother Tree bear a single great golden fruit the size of an ox. It does not weigh nearly as much as one would expect. This fruit could be used to create Ambrosia, but [[The Fates]] know of a way to create a brew that could cure the mind of any number of maladies. This fact could be revealed in the visions from [[Thylea]], by the Oracle, [[Vallus]], the Lotus Witch, or by the Timeless One’s mother in the Nether Sea.

Feeding some of this brew to any of the Lost Titans - a single fruit is enough to make a batch large enough to cure all the Lost Titans.

Followers of the Twin Titans may seek to steal this fruit to alleviate the mad mind of [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]]. If this occurs, make sure that the fruit is recoverable and not lost forever (have it turned into the brew already, with [[Remote Notes/Lutheria]] having refused to drink it, believing herself perfect as she is).

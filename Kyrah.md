As one of [[The Five Gods]], Kyrah is revered as the trickster of music and poetry. There are very few shrines to her, but bards and poets call upon her for inspiration as "the Muse."She is the swiftest of all the gods, both in thought and deed. She is capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye, and she can travel great distances with mere steps. Her mind is equally swift. Her voice is said to be more beautiful than any instrument.

Kyrah regularly travels through the Heartlands in the guise of an adventurous bard. She carries dozens of scroll-cases with her, most of which contain terrible poems of her own composition. She can write good ones, but she prefers the bad ones, because she is so amused by people's reactions to them. No matter how harsh the critique, she never holds grudges against critics. She serves as the court poet to the Queen of Mytros, her sister [[Vallus]]. [[Vallus]] finds Kyrah annoying, and she finds any excuse to send her away on errands.

## Kyrah's Motivations

Kyrah wishes above all else to write a great epic poem, something that would make even the Mother Goddess herself laugh and weep. In her search for new material, she is attracted to heroes who perform great deeds, as well as those who are fated to meet terrible ends. She is flirty, witty, clever, and attractive, but for reasons that she never makes clear, will never consent to marry anyone who cannot beat her in a foot race.

## Kyrah's True Form

Kyrah came to [[Thylea]] as a young bronze dragon. She served as the mount for the infamous Dragonlord [[Estor Arkelander]]. She is still weighed down by shame for the atrocities that Estor committed while the two of them were oathsworn. Kyrah cannot transform back into her dragon form until [[The Oath of Peace]] ends.

## Roleplaying Kyrah

Spirited. Kyrah seeks to atone for the sins of [[Estor Arkelander]] by doing as much good as possible. She is full of optimistic energy, and she refuses to stand by when even the slightest injustices go uncorrected and unpunished.

Reckless. Kyrah detests sitting still, and her eagerness for a good story makes her a bit reckless. She will sometimes goad mortals into dangerous acts of heroism, hoping for dramatic material that she can use. However, she never acts maliciously, and she is careful to study prophecies; she doesn't make unreasonable demands.

Mischevious. Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small. Consequently, few people worship her, but nearly everyone believes in her. She is often "credited"when things go missing, or when objects suddenly reappear without explanation. She is especially fond of playing pranks on humorless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King [[Acastus]] of Mytros.

## Kyra's Plan
She learned a lot about the Titans, the way they play with the Oaths's limits, causing actions that indirectly have bad consequences for the Five but do not breach [[The Oath of Peace]]. Kyrah's plan is to use [[Versi]]'s Prophecy to sponsor a band of heroes, tools towards her goals :

- She hopes the heroes will take initiative against the Titans, for example understand that she is not responsible for her follower's brash actions, but this has to be subtle else she'll be considered oathbreaker.
- She has to find worthy champions to take the lead, to replace the Five when they will be gone. However she doesn't want to win at all cost, she won't support evil actions from the Heroes, as it would only cause the Five to be replaced by evil champions, and wouldn't want to make a choice between lesser evils, to have [[Thylea]] dominated by evil dragonlords instead of evil Titans. Of course, she should never break [[The Oath of Peace]], bluntly asking the heroes to attack the Titans or their followers, or denying them their right of appeasement. Those are the reason she asks the heroes of the prophecy :
	- to prove themselves, to gain fame among the population and gain credit, some DM would add also to gain experience,
	- to become worthy champions able to defend the settlers in her place after [[The Oath of Peace]] ends,
	- to negociate a new Oath of Peace if possible. But if a new Oath isn't feasible, which she rightly supposes, she still will have managed to train heroes for the coming war, and she hopes the hints she will provide will allow the heroes to win this !

Outsmarting the Titans and Oaths is the name of the game for her, and that should slowly appear to your players as being their moto too.

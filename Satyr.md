Satyrs are a race of fey creatures with a strong link to the Feywild and all of the creatures and races that come from that place. They prefer forested wilderness but are not afraid to enter towns and cities to enjoy the company and other benefits of civilization.

## Goat Men
Satyrs have the lower body of a goat and the upper body of an elf. A pair of goat-like horns sprout from their foreheads. These horns can range from small spikes to huge horns worthy of a mountain goat. In addition to a full head of hair, satyrs grow fur on their arms, legs, and torsos. Some satyrs grow less fur, and many choose to carefully shave the hair from their arms and body. They can have brown, black, blonde, red, grey, or white hair. Their skin color ranges from dark to pale.

## Hedonistic
Satyrs are in tune with their emotions to a degree that can be disturbing to other races. They want to experience everything: happiness, sadness, love, rage, etc. The only thing they avoid is boredom.

They love music, wine, and dancing. They also enjoy an interest in carnal pleasures, and they are not afraid to share a bed with any of the other intelligent races.

## Music Lovers
Satyrs love to listen to music. They will happily spend long stretches of time both playing and composing new music. They are known to travel great distances to hear new songs, instruments, and poetry.

## Satyrs in [[Thylea]]
Satyrs don't have the same strained relationship with the civilized races of [[Thylea]] that the centaurs do. Satyrs can be found in many towns and villages throughout [[Thylea]], as well as the great city of Mytros. They are attracted to the abundance of experiences that civilization provides: the food, the wine, and most especially the music.

The civilized races of [[Thylea]] are suspicious of satyrs, for there are many stories of satyrs seducing and corrupting both the old and the young alike.

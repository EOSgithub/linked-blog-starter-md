_As witnessed by Aenor, Royal Scribe of Mytros_

When the philosopher entered the throne hall, I nearly laughed.

Another one. Another sage come to lecture King Acastus on virtue, on restraint, on the proper ordering of the polis. 

This one seemed barely out of the Academy. Mid-twenties at most, with the gentle bearing of someone who'd spent more time with books than blades. His robes were travel-worn but clean, he carried himself with that particular confidence of youth that hasn't yet learned to fear kings.

I prepared my stylus to record another brief audience, another dismissal, another philosopher sent away with royal mockery ringing in his ears. My eyes drifted, as they often did, to Queen Vallus on her throne—once the Goddess of Wisdom, now little more than a trophy wife. These past months she'd become a beautiful ornament, silent and still, dressed in sunset silks that Acastus chose for her. The court whispered that she hadn't spoken at council in half a year.

A goddess reduced to decoration. It should have been tragic, but it had become simply... normal.

"Your Majesty," the young philosopher said, bowing with perfect courtesy. "Your Radiance. I've come to discuss a proposition of mutual benefit."

His name was... I know he told us his name. I was preparing to write it down. But now, trying to recall, I find only a gap where memory should be.

King Acastus didn't even look up from the ledger he was contemplating. "Another teacher come to instruct us in wisdom? How tedious. Vallus, my dear, perhaps you'd like to debate whatever tired paradox—"

"You're... late?"

Queen Vallus spoke for the first time in months. Her voice was rust on silver, unused, uncertain. But her grey eyes—those dead things Acastus had made of them—locked onto the young philosopher.

The philosopher smiled. It was warm, genuinely delighted.
"Forgiveness, Radiance. The Eighth Configuration is... difficult to carry. It keeps trying to solve itself."

That's when I noticed his shadow was calculating.

Not him—his shadow. It moved independently, scratching formulae in the dust motes floating through the air. Geometric proofs that existed for heartbeats before dissolving into theorems I couldn't quite grasp.

Acastus finally looked up, wine cup frozen halfway to his lips. "What did you call my wife?"

"What she is." The philosopher—the Deliverer, as I would come to know him—reached into his robes and withdrew a scroll. "What she was. What she could be again, if she chooses."

"Don't." Vallus's voice cracked. "Please. I chose this. I chose to forget."

"You chose survival," the Deliverer said gently. "There's no shame in that. But Radiance, the old pacts stir. What's coming will require—"

"Someone else's wisdom." She turned her face away. "I'm done with knowing things that i should not."

"Guards—" Acastus began.

"Are reconsidering their career choices." The Deliverer's voice remained gentle. "Don't worry. They'll return when they remember why they wanted to be soldiers."

Only then did I notice the guards standing frozen at their posts, staring at their own hands, lips moving in silent calculation.

The Deliverer unrolled his scroll. The air began to taste of copper and consequence. "May I show you something? Both of you. It's important you both see this."

"More philosophy?" Acastus's voice dripped contempt.

"No lectures. Just... mathematics. The kind they don't teach in the Academy." He began sketching with chalk The symbols hung like accusations, like promises. "Thirteen years ago, a goddess chose sleep. But suppressed wisdom doesn't vanish. It accumulates. Compounds."

"Stop." Vallus's word was a plea.

But the Deliverer continued, his voice kind but relentless. "Every unanswered prayer. Every truth denied. Every seeker turned away. They had to go somewhere. The divine arithmetic demands balance."

"She made her choice!" Acastus stood, hand on his blade. "She chose me. Chose mortality. Chose—"

"Chose to be small enough for you to love," the Deliverer finished. There was no judgment in his voice, only sadness. "I understand. We all make ourselves less for love sometimes. But the cost—"

"What cost?" Vallus was standing now, trembling. "What are you trying to tell me?"

The Deliverer's shadow danced faster, adding its own calculations to the growing pattern. "The wisdom you suppressed has been building pressure. Like a dam holding back divinity itself. And dams, Radiance... dams eventually break."

"You're lying." But her voice wavered.

He completed a portion of the pattern. Reality shimmered, showing—just for a moment—the weight of accumulated divine knowledge pressing against the boundaries of existence. Vallus gasped.

"That's... that's all mine?"

"Thirteen years of suppressed godhood. Growing. Festering. Becoming something else." The Deliverer knelt, spreading his scroll fully. "The Eighth Configuration isn't just theory. It's triage. A way to release the pressure before it—"

"Before it explodes and takes half of Thylea with it," Vallus finished, her face pale. "Oh fates. What have I done?"

"What you had to." The Deliverer looked at Acastus. "What you both had to. Love makes us do impossible things. But now we need to do something else impossible—control the release."

Acastus moved to his wife's side, possessive but also protective. "And you just happen to have the solution? How convenient."

"I have _a_ solution. Not a good one. Not a safe one." The Deliverer's shadow writhed, adding desperate calculations. "But better than letting the pressure build until it cracks."

"Show me," Vallus whispered.

"Vallus, no—" Acastus began.

"Show me!" Her voice held an echo of the goddess she'd been. "If I've doomed us all with my cowardice, at least let me see it!"

The Deliverer began to draw in earnest now. The Eighth Configuration bloomed across the marble. It was beautiful and terrible, like seeing the skeleton of thought itself.

"It's a proof," he explained as he worked. "A mathematical argument that divinity itself is just another system. Once you understand the system—"

"You can control it," Vallus breathed. She was kneeling now, studying the pattern with eyes that remembered how to see beyond mortal limits. "Or escape it. Or—" Her face changed. "Or unmake it entirely."

"The titans fear this?" Acastus asked, despite himself drawn to the terrible elegance of the design.

"Thylea and Kentimane fled from this," the Deliverer corrected. "Why do you think they came to our lands? They were running from something. This is what they were running from—the proof of their own unnecessity."

Vallus traced a portion of the pattern with one finger. "It's incomplete."

"It needs a divine catalyst. Someone who bridges both states." The Deliverer met her eyes. "I'm sorry. If there was another way—"

"There's always another way," she said bitterly. "It's just usually worse." She looked at Acastus. 

"I'm not leaving you." Acastus's voice was iron.

"My love—"

"No." He knelt beside her, taking her hands. 

She laughed—broken bells in empty temples. "You impossible man. You never understood what you married, did you?"

"I married the woman I love. The goddess was just... baggage."

"Baggage." She shook her head, but she was smiling through tears. "Only you would call divinity baggage."

The Deliverer watched them with something like envy. "You're fortunate. Both of you. To have someone willing to follow you into transcendence."

"Did you?" Vallus asked suddenly. "Have someone, I mean? Before you found... all this?"

His shadow stilled for a moment. "I had many someones. Friends. Colleagues. A family who loved me." His voice went distant. "They couldn't follow where i was going. No one could."

"But you came back," Vallus observed. "From wherever this took you. You came back to help."

"Someone had to." He resumed drawing, each line precise, deliberate. "The knowledge exists now. If I don't control its release, someone else will find it. Someone less... careful."

The pattern was nearly complete. One final connection between states—

"Wait." Acastus grabbed the Deliverer's wrist. "If she does this—what happens to her?"

The Deliverer's shadow twisted, performing calculations none of them wanted to see. "If it works as designed? She'll transcend the artificial boundary. She'll become something new. Something free."

"And if it doesn't work?"

A pause. Too long.

"Then she'll join the gods in the tombs I found. Solved. Simplified. Reduced to the purest form of nothing."

"Absolutely not—"

"Acastus." Vallus's voice was gentle. "The pressure is building either way. At least this gives us a chance to direct it."

"There has to be another—"

"There is no other way!" The Deliverer's composure finally cracked. "Do you think I wanted this? Do you think I came here hoping to feed a goddess to her own suppressed divinity? I've tried every other configuration! This is what works!"

His shadow lashed out, carving desperate addendums to the pattern. "I'll add every safeguard I know. But we have to try, or—"

He gestured, and they all saw it. Cracks were already forming. Things that should not be were beginning to leak through.

"Do it," Vallus said quietly. "Complete your Configuration. Let's see what thirteen years of denied godhood looks like when it comes home."

She placed her finger at the crucial junction.

Reality divided by zero.

The world... clarified. Everything became exactly what it was, no more, no less. And Vallus—

"I see it!" she cried. "Every prayer I didn't answer! Every truth I let die! They're all here, all trying to solve themselves through me! I can feel the Configuration pulling, simplifying—"

Her form began to flicker. Reducing to components, then to relationships, then to the pure mathematics of meaning without substance.

"No!" The Deliverer dove forward, his shadow spreading like spilled ink. 

But the Configuration had tasted divinity and found it delicious. It pulled at Vallus, trying to simplify her into the perfect expression of wisdom—which was, ultimately, nothing at all.

"Let me go," she gasped. "It's beautiful. So clean. So perfect. No more choosing, no more failing, no more—"

Her form was nearly gone now. The equations crawled over her like hungry things, each one simplifying another piece of her existence. In moments, she would be nothing but a perfectly solved proof.

"The pattern's too strong!" The Deliverer was frantically drawing counter-equations, trying to introduce errors. "I can't—it's rejecting every paradox I give it!"

Acastus watched his wife dissolve into mathematics, and something primal snapped inside him. Not rage. Not fear. Something older and more fundamental than either.

He drove his fist directly into the Configuration.

The pattern screamed. 
His hand burned. The equations tried to solve him, too, crawling up his arm like fire. But he pushed deeper, reaching through the theorems toward the fading ghost of his wife.

"Solve this, you wretched abomination!" he snarled.
His fingers found Vallus, and he grabbed it with the blind possessiveness of a child refusing to share a toy.

The Configuration convulsed. It tried to solve his intervention, to reduce his love to mere chemistry, his possession to simple primate behavior. But Acastus wasn't acting from love—not pure love. This was something uglier and more real. The desire to own. To keep. To deny the universe something just because he could.

"She's MINE," he roared, and pulled.

Vallus gasped back into existence, fractured, pulled from the edge of perfect nonexistence by imperfect, possessive need.

The Configuration reeled, and then, denied its prize, it turned on its creator.

"No—" The Deliverer had one moment to see the equations pivoting toward him, seeking something to complete themselves against. 

His shadow writhed, trying to help its caster, adding its own calculations to his defense. But that gave him an idea. A terrible idea.

With effort he separated himself from his shadow, deliberately sacrificing it to the Configuration. The equations, hungry for something to solve, fell upon it.

His name went with the shadow. I felt it vanish from my memory like smoke, leaving only the word others had called him—Deliverer.

He looked at Vallus, cradled in Acastus's burned arms. At the Configuration, now stable but incomplete, feeding on his shadow's endless calculations. 

"I thought I was bringing liberation, but I was bringing..."

"Annihilation," Vallus finished softly.

"Yes." He moved toward the door.

"You'll try again?" Acastus's voice held warning.

"I have to." The Deliverer paused at the threshold, swaying slightly. 
"But not like this. Never like this. I'll find others—mortals who dream of freedom, gods who tire of their chains. I'll show them what I learned here."

"The gods and titans will hunt you," Vallus said. "When they learn what you're attempting—"

"Let them come. And I'm sorry. For what I nearly did to you."

He left, and the throne room fell silent.

Acastus looked at me then, suddenly remembering I'd witnessed everything. "Scribe. You'll write that a madman came with heretical theories. That he tried to corrupt the queen with false proofs. That he fled when he failed."

"The shadow?" I gestured to the writhing darkness still calculating in the corner.

"A stain. Nothing more. Perhaps we'll hang a tapestry over it."

I nodded, already composing the lies that would become history. But between the official words, I write this truth:

The Deliverer lives. Somewhere, he seeks others who would be free. He bears the scars of his attempt: no shadow, no name, only purpose refined by failure.

They want the same thing—the Deliverer and the Heroes of Change who will come. Freedom of Mortals from divine tyranny. 

I cannot write his name—the equation took that. I cannot fully recall his face—the pattern ate most of those memories.

But I will never forget the colour of his hair. Green as spring. Green as hope. Green as the promise that even broken things might find a way to matter.

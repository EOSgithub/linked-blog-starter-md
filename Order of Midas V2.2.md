Blood Hunters of the Order of Midas are bound to a unique and terrible curse—one that turns their own blood into liquid gold and their enemies into wealth.

### Rite of the Gilded
_Starting when you choose this order at 3rd level, your Crimson Offering manifests as shimmering golden energy._

- Your Crimson Offering damage type becomes **force damage**.
- When you hit a creature with a weapon imbued with your Crimson Offering, it **cannot regain hit points** until the start of your next turn.
- When you kill a {Medium/Large/Huge/Titanic} creature while your Crimson Offering is active, you **gain gold pieces** equal to {1/2/4/8} rolls of your **Hemocraft Die**.
- As a **reaction** when you are hit by an attack, you can **reduce the damage** by a roll of your **Hemocraft Die**.

### Blood Weapon
_At 3rd level, you can shape your own blood into deadly weapons._

As a **bonus action**, you can make two **Vital Sacrifice**s to create a melee weapon with the following properties:
- Its **damage type is force** and its damage equals your **Hemocraft Die**.
- Your **Crimson Offering is permanently imbued** on it.
- **It lasts until you dismiss it** as a bonus action or until you finish a **short or long rest**.
- You can decide what form it takes, granting it:
	- Proficency bonus weapon properties. 
		- *Finesse, Light, Heavy, Two Handed, Reach, Thrown(20/60), Versatile, Magical(+1/+2/+3)*

### Alchemical Flesh
_At 7th level, your golden affliction has strengthened your body beyond limits._

- When you make a **Vital Sacrifice**, you gain **temporary hit points** equal to half the damage taken (rounded down).
- When you reduce a creature to **0 hit points** with a Blood Weapon, you gain temporary hit points equal to your **Hemocraft Die**.
- When you take damage from a melee attack while having temporary hit points, the attacker suffers **force damage** equal to one roll of your **Hemocraft Die**.

### Exotic Weapons
*As part of a long rest, you can consume a magic melee weapon to which you are attuned, permanently adding one of its properties to the Exotic Weapon property list. (This process destroys the original weapon).*

**Harpooning.** When you score a hit with a thrown ranged attack against a Huge creature or smaller, the target cannot move further than 20 feet away from you as long as you hold the rope. A creature can try to tip out the harpoon by expending an attack and succeding on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. When the harpoon is removed the target gains 1 stack of bleeding.

**Adamantine.** Any hit made with an adamantine weapon against an object or construct is a critical hit, and adamantine armor is treated as normal armor.

**Armor Piercing.** You have advantage on attack rolls when attacking a creature that has a natural AC of 18 or higher.

**Slaying.** When you hit a creature with an Slaying weapon, the target takes an additional  weapon die of damage if it is of one of the following creature types (chosen when gaining this property): aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes or plants.

**Defensive.** While you are wielding this weapon and no shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. You can add this bonus only once.

**Executing.** You have advantage on attacks against a paralyzed, restrained, surprised or unconscious creature and you can roll one additional damage die when determining the damage it takes.

**Stirring Dragon's Wrath.** The weapon deals an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit.

Jasena Ventrak, oathsworn of Arystonar, disappeared and considered a traitor by [[Damon]]. Can be made male, good Vanished One possibility, a dragonlord who was convinced by [[Versi]] that the real war would be fought 500 years in the furture (good choice for a Medusae curse : she broke her oath to the order when vanishing, but did it for a greater good). Or she might have tried to infiltrate Praxis to get her captured dragon back (see Aesop's message who thinks they were captured) and her stuff can be found there, or she died in Aresia out of grief trying to find him as she tracked him there.

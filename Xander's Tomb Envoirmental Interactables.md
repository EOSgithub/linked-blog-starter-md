### I. Elevation Mechanics
1. **Central Dais/Platform:**
    - **Height:** 10ft elevated above the main floor.
    
    - **Mechanic: Devastating Plunge:** When a creature moves from the dais to a lower elevation, his first successful melee attack before the end of his turn deals an additional **2d8 bludgeoning damage**. If this attack hits a creature, that creature must make a **DC 16 Strength saving throw** or be knocked prone and pushed 10ft away.

2. **Side "Towers" / Alcoves:**
    - **Height:** 20ft high above the main floor.

    - **Mechanic: Strategic Vantage Point:** Ranged attacks (weapon or spell) made from these positions gain a **+2 bonus to hit** and ignore half cover.
    
    - **Mechanic: Terrifying Collapse:** As an action, a creature can try to topple a tower. Make a **DC 25 Athletic check**. On a success, the tower violently collapses. All creatures on the tower or within 5ft of its base must make a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw**. On a failure, they take **4d8 bludgeoning damage** and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and are not knocked prone. The area where the tower stood becomes a 10ft radius of difficult terrain filled with rubble.

2. **Mechanic: Incendiary Toss:** As an action, a creature can use an action to make a **DC 20 Atheltic Check** to kick or throw a brazier up to 40ft. It lands with immense force, dealing **4d6 fire damage** in a 10ft radius (**DC 16 Dexterity save** for half). The impact area also becomes a 10ft radius of burning difficult terrain (1d6) until the end of the next round. 

### III. The Amphorae
1. **Mechanic: Volatile Contents:** An amphora (AC 10, 1 HP) can be destroyed by a melee attack or launched up to 20ft with a successful **DC 18 Athletic Check**. When destroyed, roll a d3 to determine its effect:
    - **1: Dead Ashes:** It erupts in a 10ft radius cloud of powdered smoke, **heavily obscured terrain** that lasts until the start of the end of the next round. Creatures ending their turn in the ashes must make a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or be poisoned for 1 minute (save at end of each turn to end).
    
    - **2: Corrosive Agent:** It spills a 10ft radius pool of corrosive liquid. Any creature entering or starting its turn in the pool takes **2d6 acid damage**.
    
    - **3: Slick Oil:** It spills a 10ft radius of slick oil. Any creature moving while within the area must make a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** or fall prone. If ignited by fire, the oil burns for 1 hour, dealing 2d6 fire damage to creatures entering or starting their turn in it.

### IV. Shallow Water Fountain
1. **Mechanic: Stagnant Mire of Souls:** The water is 2ft deep and costs double movement to move through. Any creature _ending_ its turn in the water takes **3d6 necrotic and cold damage**. Graxis is immune to this damage and movement penalty.

2. **Mechanic: Cursed pedestals:** When a creature moves adjacent to a pedestal or starts its turn there, it triggers an effect:
    - **Pedestal 1 (Wrath):** Emits a wave of uncontrolled force. All creatures within 10ft of the pedestal must make a **DC 15 Strength saving throw** or be pushed 15ft away and knocked prone. Graxis is immune to being pushed by this effect.
    
    - **Pedestal 2 (Despair):** Floods the mind with ancient horrors. All creatures within 10ft of the pedestal must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or be Frightened until the end of their next turn.
    
    - **Pedestal 3 (Decay):** Drains vitality. All creatures within 10ft of the pedestal take **3d6 necrotic damage** (half damage on a successful **DC 15 Constitution saving throw**). This damage ignores resistance.

### VII. Fallen Rubble (Randomly on the Floor)
1. **Mechanic: Hard Cover:** Some larger rubble piles (e.g., 5ft squares) provide **three-quarters cover** (+5 AC, +5 DEX saves) to Medium or smaller creatures. Graxis, being Large, only gains half cover from these.

2. **Mechanic: Boulder Heave :** As an action a creature can make a **DC 22 Athletic Check** to rip a piece of rubble from the floor and hurl it at a target within 30ft. This is a **Ranged Weapon Attack (+9 to hit)**, dealing **3d6 bludgeoning damage + STR** on a hit.

3. **Mechanic: Corrupting Veins:** There are visible glowing green cracks across the floor. Any creature (except Graxis) that starts its turn on a crack takes **2d6 necrotic damage**. If Graxis starts his turn on a crack, he regains **1d8 hit points** due to his cursed connection to the tomb's necromantic energies.

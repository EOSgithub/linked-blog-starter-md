# The Labyrinth Deck

#### 5 Right Path Cards
Right Path's represent characters making the correct choice when entering an intersection, pushing them closer to the exit. When revealed, the Party scores one (1) point towards exiting the labyrinth, they need 5 to find the exit.

#### 5 Dead End Cards
Dead End's represent characters taking the incorrect path, requiring them to double back and adding to the frustration of navigating the labyrinth. When revealed, Dead Ends stay in play until they fill the river, where they are then removed, and an additional monster card is added to the discard pile.

#### 2 Monsters Are Approaching Cards
Monster Cards represent the monster in the labyrinth drawing closer to the party. When revealed, the DM scores one (1) point towards a monster encounter. They need two (2) to start an encounter. At which point the party enters combat using their pre-rolled initiative, and the DM rolls for the monsters initiative and slots it in.

#### 4 Room Cards
Room Cards represent... Traps and Treasures! Players use their skills to avoid the hazards laid throughout the labyrinth and find goodies.

---
# The River of Choiches
The River represents the potential directions the party can go in and can only have 3 cards in it. 

The active player picks one card to be revealed from the river each turn and that card is then resolved. 
Dead Ends stick in the river, limiting the space for new choices.  
Once the card is resolved, the river is discarded (except for dead ends) without revealing the other choices.

---
## Round Structure
Each Party member takes a turn choosing a path to take in the maze. This happens in the initiative order established at the start of the maze. There are 4 phases in each turn:

#### Drawing Phase

The DM Draws cards and places them face down in the river until the river has three cards. 

#### Action Phase

The Party Member can choose an action from the available actions and use them. Once an action is used, it can not be used again until all other actions are used. These actions are global, meaning if one party member uses the STR action, no one else can until all other actions are taken.

#### Choosing Phase

The Party Member decides which card they want to flip over. 

The card is flipped over and its effect is resolved. 

#### The Cleanup Phase

Once a card is flipped up, and its effect has resolved, discard all cards except dead ends to the discard pile and start a new turn. 

If you run out of cards in the deck, shuffle the discard pile to create a new deck.

#### End of Round

A round ends when each party member has taken a turn. 

If there are no actions left to use, the actions unlock and are available again for the next round. 

## Actions

There are 5 actions that can be taken by players. Once one is taken, it can not be taken again until all actions have been used and the round ends. 

  

If you have 4 players, roll 1D6 twice and remove each result from the list of available actions. If you have 5 players, roll 1D4 once and remove the result from the list of actions. This ensures that you have fewer actions then party members, forcing players to make choices about who will use which action and creating miss aligned results where the last action is one most party members might be poor at. This creates a critical thinking task but also creates some drama, maybe your unwise fighter manages to make a truly remarkable Careful Consideration about the party's next move, and that leads them out of the maze!

  

When performing an action, the active player makes a Skill Check using the stat listed next to the actions name. The DC the player is trying to beat is the Labernyths DC noted in the DMs Labyrinth table. On a success, the player follows the instructions for the Action they used, and that action is marked as Unavailable until all other actions are used. 

  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Action Name and Stat|Action Effect|
|Forge A Path (STR)|Add 2 additional Right Path cards to the discard pile from outside the game.|
|Scout Ahead (DEX)|Reveal the top card of the deck in addition to a card in the river, choose one.|
|It's Elementary! (INT)|Draw 3 cards from the deck, choose 1 and put it on the bottom of the deck. Shuffle the remaining cards and place them on top of the deck.|
|Careful Consideration (WIS)|Reveal 2 cards in the river this turn, choose one.|
|Boost Moral (CHAR)|Remove a Dead End card in the river from the game. Draw a new card from the deck and place it face down in the river.|

  

## Running the Labyrinth

Players roll for initiative when they enter the Labyrinth, this will be used to establish turn order and to lock in combat order if a monster is encountered. You should establish a DC for your Labyrinth to set how difficult it is to traverse. When a player performs an Action or tries to disarm a Trap they will need to roll greater than or equal to the Labyrinths DC to determine success. 

  

Using the Initiative established at the start of the encounter, each player then takes turns performing actions, and revealing cards from the deck. Each turn the River is cleared (except for Dead End cards) by the DM and new cards are drawn until the river has 3 cards in it. 

  

Every time a player successfully performs an action, mark off on the action table which action they used, denoting that the action cant be used until all other actions have been performed. 

  

In order to escape the Labyrinth, the party must meet the victory condition noted in the Labyrinth Table. Typically this condition is to reveal 5 Right Path cards. 

  

If the party reveals 2 Monster Cards, combat is initiated and the party faces the beast that has been tracking them through the Labyrinth. Once they defeat that monster, you remove a monster card in the deck from the game.

  

If a trap card is revealed, roll on the Labyrinth Trap Table to see which kind of trap they find. The active player can then attempt to disarm the trap. They will roll a D20 and any applicable skill to try and beat the Traps DC. If failed, the effect of the trap happens.

> _"Listen up, rookie. When I started this whole 'hunter' business, I thought a sharp blade and sharper wit would see me through. Turns out, when you're facing down what we do, you need a bit more oomph. So we learned to take their power—rip it right out of their still-twitching corpses and bind it to steel and bone. Sure, each relic comes with its own little curse, but between you and me? The look on a Great One's face when you hit it with its dead cousin's favorite trick? Priceless.

## How the Relic System Works
In this campaign, you don't choose a subclass. Instead, you gain abilities by finding and attuning to **Relics**—objects that grant enhanced versions of subclass features.

Your character's progression depends on which relics you discover through exploration (hidden in the megacity of Luyhrna), combat (Dropped by Boss type foes), and quests (Given out by the major Factions). 

You can mix and match relics or focus on collecting a matching set for additional bonuses.

### Relic Slots
Your level determines how many relics you can attune to:
- **Levels 1-4:** 3 slots
- **Levels 5-8:** 4 slots
- **Levels 9-12:** 5 slots
- **Levels 13-16:** 6 slots
- **Levels 17-20:** 7 slots

_Note: Common and Uncommon magic items no longer require attunement. Only Rare or higher rarity items use relic slots._

### Relic Tiers
Tier 1 (Levels 1-4): Entry-level relics that grant foundational abilities. These can be a little more powerful than standard subclass features and carry minor effects that add flavor without hindering gameplay whatsoever.

Tier 2 (Levels 5-10): Mid-tier relics providing significantly enhanced abilities with additional effects. Their curses create roleplay opportunities while still not hindering combat.

Tier 3 (Levels 11-16): Powerful relics granting abilities that exceed normal features. Found in the most dangerous locations, their price present character challenges.

Tier 4 (Levels 17-20): Artifacts that fundamentally alter gameplay. These require extraordinary feats to obtain and carry campaign altering consequences.

##### Example: **Crown of the Usurper**
- **Class:** Warlock
- **Set:** Frozen Prince - Tier 2
- **Feature - Seeds of Betrayal:** Creatures that have not yet taken a turn in combat have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells that impose the charmed or frightened condition. Creatures charmed or frightened by you treat their allies as hostile.
- **Price:** Your breath visibly mists in warm air, and food tastes bland. You gain the ability to consume Heat instead of nourishement. The best thing is the heat from ?.

_Note: Each Relic is class restricted._

> _"Restricted? Ha! Kid, let me tell you about the time I found a relic that taught my Fighter friend how to cast Fireball. Sure, it was made from the crystallized last breath of a dying star-thing, and yes, we had to kill something that made dragons look like house pets, but the look on that Cultist's face when the 'dumb warrior' started slinging spells? Priceless."_

## Set Bonuses
Collecting multiple relics from the same set grants cumulative bonuses unique to that set.

##### Example: **Frozen Prince Set Bonus**
**2 Pieces:** You gain resistance to cold damage and immunity to the frightened condition.

**3 Pieces:** Once per short rest, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can cause it to rise as an ice statue under your control for 1 minute (as _animate dead_, but the creature has vulnerability to fire damage).

**4 Pieces:** Your spells that deal damage can deal cold damage instead of their normal type. When you do so, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

**5 Pieces:** You gain the ability to cast _cone of cold_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Additionally, creatures frozen solid by your magic (reduced to 0 hp by cold damage) can be shattered to prevent any form of resurrection.

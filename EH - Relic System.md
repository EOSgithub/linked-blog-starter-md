In this campaign, you don't choose a subclass. 

Instead, you gain abilities by finding and attuning to **Relics**—objects that grant subclass-like features. You will be able to mix and match relics or focus on collecting matching sets for additional bonuses.

The progression of your character will depend on the relics you will acquire through:
- **Exploration:** Discover hidden relics within the fogotten depths of Luyhrna.
- **Combat:** Defeat powerful boss-type foes and make their powers yours. 
- **Faction Quests:** Earn relics as rewards from the five major factions vying for control of the city.

## Character Creation Addendum                      
**Choose (or Create a concept of) a Relic Set** that resonates with your character and obtain a **Tier 1 relic** from it during creation.

**Weave it into your backstory**: 
- How did you acquire your first relic? 
- What drives you to complete the set? 

This generates your **Hunter's Journey**—guaranteed story moments where you'll gain additional relics from your chosen set.

| Level   | Milestone                 | Guaranteed Reward                     |

_Each proactive hunter finds 3-4 times more relics through exploration and investigation._

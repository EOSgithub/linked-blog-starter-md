> _"Listen up, rookie. When I started this whole 'hunter' business, I thought a sharp blade and sharper wit would see me through. Turns out, when you're facing down what we do, you need a bit more oomph. So we learned to take their power—rip it right out of their still-twitching corpses and bind it to steel and bone... It ain’t pretty, but it works. And out here, that's all that matters._

## How the Relic System Works
In this campaign, you don't choose a subclass. 

Instead, you gain abilities by finding and attuning to **Relics**—objects that grant subclass features. You will be able to mix and match relics or focus on collecting a matching set for additional bonuses. Imagine your beloved rogue with both Fast Hands and Psychic Blades!

Your character begins their journey with a tier 1 relic of your choosing from the campaign classes and a random one from the PHB 2024, which you will weave into their backstory. From there, their progression depends on the relics you will acquire through:
- **Exploration:** Discover hidden relics within the fogotten depths of Luyhrna.
- **Combat:** Defeat powerful boss-type foes and make their powers yours. 
- **Quests:** Earn relics as rewards from the five major factions vying for control of the city.

### Attunement Slots
Your proficency bonus determines how many objects you can attune to:
**Levels 1-4:** 4 slots
**Levels 5-8:** 6 slots
**Levels 9-12:** 8 slots
**Levels 13-16:** 10 slots
**Levels 17-20:** 12 slots

_Note: Common and Uncommon magic items no longer require attunement. Only Rare+ items and Relics use attunement slots._

### Relic Tiers
**Tier 1:** Entry-level relics that grant foundational abilities—ranging from actual standard subclass features to slightly more powerful ones. Their "prices" take the form of beneficial traits that reinforce the set’s theme in a positive and flavorful way.

**Tier 2:** Mid-tier relics that offer core abilities with added effects. Their prices remain beneficial but begin to hint at something deeper—a subtle mechanical cost that foreshadows future changes.

**Tier 3:** High-tier relics that grant abilities surpassing standard features. Their prices grow ambiguous, blurring the line between blessing and curse while deepening the thematic weight of the set.

**Tier 4:** One of a kind relics that bend or rewrite the rules of the game. Acquiring one requires extraordinary feats and carries campaign-altering consequences. Their prices represent twisted reflections of the original theme—a corruption of mortal concepts, yet still rooted in the relic set’s core identity.

### Example Relic & Set Bonus
#### Crown of the Usurper
- **Class Restriction:** Warlock or Sorcerer
- **Set:** Pale Monarch - Tier 2
- **Feature - Seeds of Betrayal:** Creatures that have not yet taken a turn in combat have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells that deal cold damage or impose the charmed or frightened condition. Creatures charmed or frightened by you treat their allies as hostile.
- **Price:** Your breath forms soft mist, and food tastes bland. You no longer need to eat or drink — instead, you are sustained by moments of warmth: the laughter of friends around a fire, the radiant light of hope in another's eyes, the glow of kindness offered when none was owed. These moments keep the cold at bay… for now.

#### Pale Monarch - Set Bonus
**2 Pieces:** You gain resistance to cold damage and immunity to the frightened condition.

**3 Pieces:** Once per short rest, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to rise it as an ice statue under your control for 1 minute (as _animate dead_, but the creature has vulnerability to fire damage).

**4 Pieces:** Your spells that deal damage can deal cold damage instead of their normal type. When you do so, you ignore resistance to cold damage and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

**5 Pieces:** You gain the ability to cast _cone of cold_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Additionally, creatures frozen solid by your magic (reduced to 0 hp by cold damage) can be shattered to prevent any form of resurrection.

> _"Ha! Kid, let me tell you about the time I found a relic that taught my barbarian friend some tricks. Sure, it was made from the crystallized last breath of a dying star-thing, and yes, we had to kill something that made a lich look like my racist gandpa, but the look on that Cultist's face when the 'dumb orc warrior' counterspelled his Misty Step?

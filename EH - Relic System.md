> _"Listen up, rookie. When I started this whole 'hunter' business, I thought a sharp blade and sharper wit would see me through. Turns out, when you're facing down what we do, you need a bit more oomph. So we learned to take their power—rip it right out of their still-twitching corpses and bind it to steel and bone. Sure, each relic comes with its own little quirk, but between you and me? The look on a Great One's face when you hit it with its son's favorite trick? Priceless.

## How the Relic System Works
In this campaign, you don't choose a subclass. 
Instead, you gain abilities by finding and attuning to **Relics**—objects that grant enhanced versions of subclass features.
You can mix and match relics or focus on collecting a matching set for additional bonuses.

Your character's progression depends on which relics you discover through exploration (Hidden in the depths of Luyhrna), combat (Dropped by Boss type foes), and quests (Given out by the major Factions). 

---
### Relic Slots
Your level determines how many relics you can attune to:
- **Levels 1-4:** 3 slots
- **Levels 5-8:** 4 slots
- **Levels 9-12:** 5 slots
- **Levels 13-16:** 6 slots
- **Levels 17-20:** 7 slots

_Note: Common and Uncommon magic items no longer require attunement. Only Rare or higher rarity items use relic slots._

### Relic Tiers
**Tier 1:** Entry-level relics that grant foundational abilities. These can be a little more powerful than standard subclass features. Their "prices" are actually beneficial traits that reinforce the set's theme in a positive light.

**Tier 2:** Mid-tier relics providing significantly enhanced abilities with additional effects. Their prices remain beneficial but hint at something deeper—a mechanical effect that foreshadows the next stages. 

**Tier 3:** Powerful relics granting abilities that exceed normal features. Their prices become ambiguous and unsettling. The line between blessing and curse blurs.

**Tier 4:** Artifacts that fundamentally alter the rules. These require extraordinary feats to obtain and carry campaign altering consequences. Their prices are perversions of the initial concept— the reversal of hope, yet still thematically connected to the set's core identity.

##### Example: **Crown of the Usurper**
- **Class:** Warlock
- **Set:** Frozen Prince - Tier 2
- **Feature - Seeds of Betrayal:** Creatures that have not yet taken a turn in combat have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells that impose the charmed or frightened condition. Creatures charmed or frightened by you treat their allies as hostile.
- **Price:** Your breath forms soft mist, and food tastes bland. You no longer need to eat or drink — instead, you are sustained by moments of warmth: the laughter of friends around a fire, the radiant light of hope in another's eyes, the glow of kindness offered when none was owed. These moments keep the cold at bay… for now.

> _"Ha! Kid, let me tell you about the time I found a relic that taught my Fighter some tricks. Sure, it was made from the crystallized last breath of a dying star-thing, and yes, we had to kill something that made a liche look like house pet, but the look on that Cultist's face when the 'dumb orc warrior' counterspelled his Misty Step? Unforgettable."_

## Set Bonuses
Collecting multiple relics from the same set grants cumulative bonuses unique to that set.

##### Example: **Frozen Prince Set Bonus**
**2 Pieces:** You gain resistance to cold damage and immunity to the frightened condition.

**3 Pieces:** Once per short rest, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to rise as an ice statue under your control for 1 minute (as _animate dead_, but the creature has vulnerability to fire damage).

**4 Pieces:** Your spells that deal damage can deal cold damage instead of their normal type. When you do so, you ignore resistance and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

**5 Pieces:** You gain the ability to cast _cone of cold_ once per long rest without expending a spell slot. Additionally, creatures frozen solid by your magic (reduced to 0 hp by cold damage) can be shattered to prevent any form of resurrection.

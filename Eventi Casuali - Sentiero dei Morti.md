The Dungeon Master or players will roll two d100 dice to determine the encounter. The first roll dictates the encounter type, and the second specifies the encounter itself.

## Encounter Type
- **1-25: No Encounter.** Travel is uneventful regarding encounters, though environmental factors like weather or other exploration variables might still pose challenges.
    
- **26-65: Combat Encounter.** The heroes discover (or are discovered by) adversaries or enemies, who are fundamentally aggressive NPCs. The expected solution is fighting, though escaping is sometimes an option.
    
- **66-95: Exploration Encounter.** The heroes find an element of roleplaying or worldbuilding. While violence can still occur, most situations involve places, creatures, or NPCs that won't initiate combat, instead serving to showcase interesting aspects of the area, from flora and fauna to religion and the supernatural.
    
- **95-100: Loot Encounter.** The heroes are fortunate and discover something valuable. This might be guarded, requiring some struggle (not necessarily combat) to obtain, but it should be reasonably worth the party's time. The goal of this reward is to be useful and flavorful (even simple loot for selling or trading), but not necessarily to significantly or permanently increase the heroes' power level.

## Combat Encounters (Roll 26-65 on Encounter Type)
If the first d100 roll is between 26 and 65, the party will encounter a combat situation. These involve various creatures and characters likely leading to a conflict worthy of rolling initiative, even if not all scenarios require killing foes. Sometimes, a party may choose to escape, use crowd control, or otherwise resolve the problem non-violently. While not all scenarios offer this, it should be considered.

**Roll d100 for Specific Combat Encounter:*
- **01-10: Birds of Prey** Suddenly, loud calling and hissing come from above. A black and red tornado of flying beasts, fighting with beak and claw, crashes next to the heroes, pulling them into the chaos.
    - **Creatures:** 2d6 Blood Hawks, 2d6 Vultures, and 1d4 Giant Vultures. Many are already wounded.
    - **Tactics:** Each beast will attack either a hero or an individual from another bird group.

- **11-15: Griffon** Griffons are sacred creatures found in some of Thylea's highest mountains, including those around Telamok. They are usually left undisturbed, hunted only with great pride. As the heroes travel the Path of the Dead, they are spotted by 2 Griffons, a couple defending their territory with a nearby nest.
    - **Tactics:** They will fight to the death to protect their home if it contains eggs or young. If not, they will flee when bloodied (50% HP or less).

- **16-25: Blood Toll Harpies** The party is attacked by 2d6 Blood Toll Harpies. These creatures are victims of the Curse of the Harpy who couldn't withstand the transformation, their minds regressed by shame, pain, and guilt, turning them into violent, butchering monsters.
    - **Tactics:** They are more bestial than their singing counterparts and will focus on any wounded hero, retreating when bloodied (50% HP or less).

- **26-35: Flitterstep Eidolon** The party finds a group of 2d4 Flitterstep Eidolons along their path. These are runaway spirits from the Underworld, escaped through the broken gateway connected to Telamok. When an entity escapes that plane, it often comes out in pieces: a Returned (a body empty of its soul, recognizable by a plain golden mask it can never remove) and an Eidolon (the remaining amnesiac spirit). They will never find each other again and are usually unaware of each other's existence. These are the simplest Eidolons, stuck in a permanent state of fight or flight, speaking and screaming frequently in fear, claiming to be escaping something or someone (Lutheria’s minions).
    - **Tactics:** These creatures will attempt to fight to keep moving.

- **36-40: Ghostblade Eidolon** The party is ambushed by 1d6 Ghostblade Eidolons. They will attempt to skulk through the rocks, circle the heroes, and close in on archers and spellcasters. These are former lesser Dragonlords, runaways from the Underworld whom Damon couldn't snatch to be guardians of the Necropolis. They are now lost, seeing only a permanent battle against old foes.
    - **Tactics:** They see the heroes as enemies, subjects of the Twins. They will not converse, only scream and claim to know the heroes serve the Titans, possibly hallucinating Sydon’s red eye on outfits, ropes and knots for slaves, or black cloaks and scythes. These Dragonlords will not surrender and fight until destroyed.

- **51-55: Returned Frontline** An expedition of Returned meets the party, composed of 1d4 Returned Palamnite and 1d4 Returned Sentries.
    - **Tactics:** Vague and unintuitive, they offer no words, simply walking slowly towards the party if allowed. Palamnite, fueled by rage from undeath, are violent and sadistic, engaging in combat as soon as naive heroes get too close.

- **56-58: Cult of Lutheria - Skulk** As the heroes' tales of opposition to the Titans spread, their enemies become restless. The Cult of Lutheria, spread across Thylea, has sent a group to stop the heroes, in this case, cultists and spirits.
    - **Creatures:** The party is found or ambushed by 1d6 Cultists, 1 Cultist Fanatic, and 1d4 Skulks. A number of cultists equal to the number of Skulks are young children, responsible for summoning monstrosities. The Cult often offers them healthy but dark lives in service of the Mistress of Death.
    - **Tactics:** Usually, these zealots (including indoctrinated children) are willing to fight to the death.

- **59-65: Cult of Lutheria - Tracking the Dead** As the heroes' tales of opposition to the Titans grow, so do their enemies grow restless. The Cult of Lutheria has sent a group of summoned shadow creatures to chase the heroes.
    - **Creatures:** The party is hunted by 1d4 Shadow Mastiffs and 1 Shadow Mastiff Alpha.
    - **Tactics:** The monsters never stop moving. When they find the heroes, they will stalk them from afar and fight only when targets enter a dark place (e.g., a cave) or at night. They will attempt to surprise the party in an ambush using their Shadow Blend feature, jumping out of shadows and striking. The creatures fight until destroyed.

- **66-70: Cult of Lutheria - Permanent Black** As the heroes' tales of opposition to the Titans grow, their enemies become restless. The Cult of Lutheria has sent a coterie of undead bound to the Cult to chase the heroes.
    - **Creatures:** The party is hunted by 1d4 Deathlock Wights. These were former Cult servants bound by oaths or punishment.
    - **Tactics:** They are on the party's trail, offered release if successful. They strike as soon as they find the characters, even ignoring Sunlight Sensitivity in their desperation, and fight until destroyed.

- **71-75: Peryton** Perytons have a small population in Thylea, as mountains are unpopulated and do not have locations with large mortal transit since the Path of the Dead and Mithral Forge were abandoned. They still exist around Telamok, preying on any beast, with a particular taste for the lonely lost who exile themselves.
    - **Creatures:** As the party delves deeper along the Path of the Dead, they might be spotted by 1d6 Perytons.
    - **Tactics:** The monstrosities strike relentlessly, initiating from high above with their Dive Attack feature, focusing on any bleeding hero. They don’t give up unless death seems certain (25% HP or less), in which case they use their Flyby feature to escape. If they succeed, they will stalk the heroes, attacking when a new opportunity arises (e.g., the party being attacked by another enemy).

- **76-80: Cave Fisher** The party walks by a large cave. If heroes carry light or have Darkvision, they might find thick spider webs on the ceiling with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, with at least one large bat stuck.
    - **Creatures:** Enemies will be skulking in the shadows: spreading light reveals 1d6 Cave Fishers 35 ft. above, attempting to surprise them.
    - **Tactics:** They use simple tactics: grapple, pull, and attack. Especially if they surprise heroes, they'll use Adhesive Filament and Retract Filament, without dropping from the ceiling unless forced or if they never grapple a hero. If led here by another encounter (like Will-o’-Wisps), Cave Fishers automatically succeed on Stealth checks against heroes. They flee if certain to die (25% HP or less), or if too many in their group are killed.

- **81-85: Bone Whelk** The party comes across 1d4 Bone Whelks. These mollusks are affected by Telamok's roaming nether energy, growing and grasping bones of the dead and their victims.
    - **Tactics:** They simply attack straight on (though slow, allowing for easy escapes), and fight until destroyed.
    - **Special:** If at least one Bone Whelk is killed, its Death Scream feature attracts further foes. Immediately roll again on this Encounter Combat table; the new foes will arrive after 1d4 rounds, adjusting tactics as necessary.

- **86-90: Banshee** On their way across the Path of the Dead, the party might hear timid female cries and whispers. They may seem to come from everywhere or a specific mountain corner.
    - **Creatures:** Eventually, a single spirit materializes: a translucent-white woman in rags of a chiton, with a face stuck in rage or sorrow, skin twisting and falling. The creature is either a Banshee (a vain woman who died afflicted with the Curse of the Banshee) or a Lonelywood Banshee (a former Mytrosian warrior exiled or who committed a crime and fled to Telamok).
    - **Tactics:**
        - **Banshee:** Attacks out of greed, coveting jewelry, magic items, beautiful hair/face/body. Might hallucinate past life during the fight, struggles until destroyed.
        - **Lonelywood Banshee:** Attacks out of anger, lashing out for her misfortune. Will focus targets clearly tied to Mytros and fights with reckless abandon, aware that her curse forces her to return to Telamok even if destroyed.

- **91-95: Violent Iconoclast** Despite the horrors around Telamok, the most tragic figures on the Path of the Dead are mortals who chose it as home. These Mytrosian citizens abandoned former lives due to sorrow, fury, madness, epiphanies, etc. Most are content to live out loneliness, but some are Violent Iconoclasts, turning against gods, overcoming through rage and spite.
    - **Creatures:** The party may be spotted by 1d4 Violent Iconoclasts, bandits and thieves.
    - **Tactics:** They use Deception to pose as starving beggars. If heroes approach to help, especially frail (ranged fighters, spellcasters) or overtly religious ones, they are ambushed with hidden blades, possibly surprising them. If it becomes clear they will lose, they use their Curse feature, then surrender. They'll give up loot, but rage flashes in their eyes, and they cannot remove the curse even if they die.

- **96-98: Master of Souls** Despite the horrors around Telamok, the most tragic figures on the Path of the Dead are mortals who chose it as home. These men and women, often Mytrosian citizens, abandoned former lives due to sorrow, fury, madness, epiphanies, etc. Most are content to live out loneliness, but some are Masters of Souls, who abandoned former lives with the single intention of dying alone. They might be elders despising burdening children or patriarchs/matriarchs who lost family. In the Path of the Dead, they have changed, listening to darkness, seeing anger and emptiness of survivors, feeling harshness of stone and dust. This led to a fascination with being dead and on the final journey. Now, it's all they think about until it's their time.
    - **Creatures:** At dusk, heroes are found by 1d4 elderly men, thin and sickly.
    - **Tactics:** They are surprised by the heroes' presence, but claim they shouldn't be out at night, offering shelter in an improvised mountain structure. They have no food, only roof and water. These Masters of Souls insist characters rest, claiming their home is safe and they can keep watch. Once unconscious, they attempt to ambush the party. They are young, and especially if heroes have ties to Lutheria or are spellcasters, they may know much, and once dead, they will be forced to answer their mad questions.

- **99-100: The Horrors** In this age, as Lutheria’s grasp on her responsibilities twists, signs of abandonment appear. One is the presence of aberrations, beings not naturally belonging to Thylea (like beasts) nor creations of Lutheria/Underworld (like monstrosities/undead). Lady of Dreams instrumentalized these otherworldly beings, allowing them to exist as long as they fit her needs or amuse her. The Horrors are the only Aberrations present around Telamok.
    - **Determine Horror:** Roll an additional 1d10 to determine which Horror ambushes, stalks, or attacks:
        - **1-4:** 2 Flying Horrors
        - **4-8:** 1 Shadow Horror
        - **9-10:** 1 Skittering Horror
    - **Description & Tactics:** These beings should be a horrifying sight, clearly not belonging anywhere, not looking, sounding, or acting like humanoids, beasts, or undead. If Kyrah (or other friendly NPCs) is present, she should realize these are alien foes, possibly beyond the heroes’ current abilities (especially the Skittering Horror), and urge them to leave.
    - **Long-term Effects:** Whatever foe the party encounters, it’ll be the only Horror existing around Telamok. They feed on living or undead beings in the region and would likely not leave voluntarily. If the party shares this experience, Mytrosian scholars might be interested in studying the creature, while the Cult of Lutheria might want to capture it. These interactions could offer rewards, roleplaying opportunities, or future foes if the Horror is taken and used against them.

## Exploration Encounters (Roll 66-95 on Encounter Type)
If the first d100 roll is between 66 and 95, the party will find an exploration encounter. These delve more heavily into worldbuilding, offering encounters with creatures, locations, etc., that don't pose much of a threat (though they can sometimes be fought), but instead reveal something about the world and the current location. These situations may also offer useful information for the overall plot or current story, though it's not a prerequisite.

**Roll d100 for Specific Exploration Encounter:**
- **01-05: Ravens** The heroes hear painful screaming from the mountains, far off their path. If they follow, they'll find the source: a gray and black bird screaming, while more gather in the sky.
    - **Outcome:** They are not aggressive, simply gathering to roost. However, if the party chased the screams, they will find themselves somewhat lost and need to find the Path of the Dead again. This can be done with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check, or by spending enough time, in which case the heroes lose half a day of travel.

- **06-10: Vultures** A band of vultures blocks the party’s path, happily feeding on a hidden carcass. As the party approaches, the birds flee but perch around the road instead of leaving.
    - **Outcome:** Their food is a somewhat old, surprisingly young man's corpse, nude and incredibly dirty, as if tossed around mountains and trails for days. Searching the body reveals nothing of value, but observing for a few minutes reveals the wounds on his body have disappeared. The man is undeniably dead: grayed skin, slightly popping eyes, immobile and cold. Kyrah might suggest the man was cursed, preventing his body from being buried or burned even if his soul is gone, instead feeding beasts and monsters, tossed around Telamok forever. His spirit will never properly reach the Nether Sea or be taken by Lutheria’s Barge to the Underworld.

- **11-15: Mountain Goats** Around particularly rough climbs and amidst the colder mountains around Telamok, the heroes might encounter a wild pack of 2d10 Mountain Goats. These have very thick white fur and very sharp, curved horns.
    - **Outcome:** If unprovoked, they remain wary. If the party taunts, enters their territory, or attacks, the beasts become wildly violent. If the party defeats and harvests them, their hide can be sold in Mytros (roughly 10 GP per hide) or used as warm traveling clothes. Their meat is edible.

- **16-20: Aurochs** These fierce bovines are usually found in the most dangerous parts of many mountains, mostly keeping to themselves. Their meat is highly valued, but only the most confident hunters go against packs.
    - **Creatures:** The party may stumble upon a pack of 2d4 Aurochs.
    - **Outcome:** The animals will not attack unless threatened, and would rather flee than fight, but will struggle if hunted. If defeated and harvested, their meat can be cooked by a competent character for a delicious meal (stronger smell and taste than regular cattle, though less soft) or sold in cities if preserved. The carcass of 1 whole auroch is worth roughly 20 GP each.

- **21-25: Will-o’-Wisp** As the party walks the Path of the Dead, especially at dusk, they see beautiful lights glimmering distantly off their track. If they approach, they will find a group of 2d4 Will-o’-Wisps: decently large balls of flickering, comforting yellow light.
    - **Outcome:** They seem harmless at first, and as heroes approach, they move above, around, and even through them, offering a pleasant, warm feeling and floating away, as if asking to be followed. This is a trap, leading them to new foes. Roll a new d100 on the Encounter Combat table. The Will-o’-Wisps fight alongside whatever monster goes against the party. Alternatively, you could pick one from these specific combat encounters: Cave Fishers, Returned Frontline, Blood Toll Harpy.

- **26-30: Boggle** From far away, the heroes discover what seems to be an improvised shelter against a mountainside, made of stone with a doorway and two windows. Approaching, they’ll find simple, old, dirty belongings: common clothes, a child's toy, old fire remains, and something small breathing under a blanket.
    - **Creatures:** If heroes try to touch it, 1d4 Boggles will jump out, attempting to surprise heroes.
    - **Tactics:** They throw slippery oil with their Oil Puddle feature while yelling to scare heroes and make them fall. They then jump on fallen heroes. They will not hurt anyone unless forced, instead trying to steal while genuinely laughing: gold/platinum coins, magic items, shiny jewelry—anything that would get a reaction. If they get valuables, they Disengage and jump through door/window frames, using Dimensional Rift to escape up/down the mountain.
    - **Outcome:** Despite their mischievous nature, Boggles don’t resist much. If one is killed, they all drop stolen items and run. If captured, it immediately drops mischief for cowardice, begging forgiveness and claiming to "only miss their friends!". They are results of extreme loneliness felt by mountain wanderers. As their creators died, these Boggles banded together, engaging in mischief when possible.

- **31-35: Lampads** At some point, an unnerving feeling creeps up the heroes’ necks: they are being watched. Their observers don’t remain hidden long; a quick look reveals a pair of odd, purple-ish beings sitting atop a large nearby rock. They get up, wave, and slowly walk towards the party.
    - **Description:** The creatures are clearly otherworldly: skin rough like wood or stone, gray as if old and petrified. It doesn’t cover their entire figure, as they are filled with holes revealing a dark interior with faded but colorful lights. Their faces are incomplete: lips and an eye, two eyes and a nose, or nothing, with varying portions of their heads composed of such holes and lights.
    - **Creatures:** These are 2 Lampads, special nymphs birthed from the waters of the Nether Sea. They rarely exist in Thylea's material plane, restricted to areas tied with that ocean or the Underworld. They act as guards, guides, and hunters, dealing with souls, escapees, or disruptors. They are among many beings placed by Lutheria to counteract Damon’s misuse of land and Underworld.
    - **Interaction:** The heroes are lucky; this pair is friendly towards the living. They have guided many mortals who sought to die in these mountains and assume this is the party’s goal. They approach and ask: “would you like our aid in abandoning your possessions? Are there any emblems of past power, wealth or valor that you would like to keep?”. Confused as the party might be, the nymphs explain their purpose. If the party refuses, the Lampads don’t mind. Not all understand what happens next, and some come to Telamok without coming to terms with perishing. It’s their choice if they do what’s necessary for a proper journey into the Underworld. The nymphs might accompany them for a while but will not interfere if the group is attacked, choosing to wait for their doom.

- **36-40: Harpy Charms** As the heroes follow the Path up a mountain, they can barely discern distant female voices singing. Soon after, they see the source: on a small peak of a neighboring mountain sits a nest of 2 Harpies and 1 Harpy Matriarch, singing deeply about the journey after death. They are far enough that their exact words and enchantment are hard to discern, but the party can still realize something is odd: below the peak, separated by a cliff, there seem to be people. A small group of about 5 humanoids, kneeling and staring up at the harpy nest.
    - **Observation & Outcome:** They are clearly entranced but too far to be helped. If heroes observe closer (e.g., detouring, Wild Shape, Polymorph, spyglass), a terrifying detail emerges: the kneeling people are mortals (human), barely alive. Their skin is dry, bodies thin and bone-like, much of their flesh dead and actively falling like a zombie. If heroes attempt to save them, the harpies will fight. They'll especially use their Luring Song feature to lead heroes to the cliff between mortals and nest: a charmed individual must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to leap to the nest, or fall 50 ft. to the next platform. If charmed, the hero might walk forward again, falling hundreds of feet to the ground.
    - **Resolution:** If Harpies and Harpy Matriarch are bloodied (50% HP), they’ll flee and abandon the nest. There is no hope for the mortals. It’s impossible to discern how long they’ve been there, and they don’t know, their perception warped by sung promises. Their stories are tragic: self-exiled from grief and madness, they wished to listen to harpy song for answers about lost families, loves, etc. At this point, the party can only help with their final rites, as the mortals are too weak to move and need proper burial to reach the Nether Sea and Underworld.

- **41-45: Death’s Head Tree** In empty plains amidst the mountains, the party might spot a single, lonely tree. Even from afar, it looks unusual – seemingly black wood and large, unnaturally-shaped fruit. It fills spectators with dread, like staring at a corpse.
    - **Discovery:** If the party detours to approach, they will discover a Death’s Head Tree: an ancient plant that has sheltered too many madmen, heard too many cries, witnessed too many crimes. This, alongside Damon’s and Lutheria’s effects on the region, has warped it, and it is now cursed, manifesting the many faces it saw over the years.
    - **Creatures:** The tree shows a varied group of 2d6 Death’s Heads.
    - **Nature:** It’s clearly an abomination created by Telamok's current state, not a natural creature. It is still a tree and does not attack unprovoked. If the party acts against it, the heads detach and attack.

- **46-50: Returned Cult** Eventually, the Path of the Dead passes between two mountains with various cave entrances. A perceptive hero might hear a low, guttural chant, and any character would hear it approaching any cave. This is a tunnel system, and moving deeper is concerning as it’s easy to get lost. It’s not a full maze, and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check is enough to exit without a guide.
    - **Discovery:** It doesn’t take long to find the chanting's source: a group of 2d4 Returned Sentries and 2 Returned Kakomantis, spread in a circle. To their left and right are recently sacrificed dead mountain goats, their blood in large bowls. In the middle, a large hole contains 3 skeletons like a jigsaw puzzle, with disjointed bones forming mortal bodies. Skulls have open, gaping mouths, each with parchment inside.
    - **Nature & Interaction:** These Returned Kakomantis are conductors of a cult centered on necromancy and the pursuit of Damon the Lich's power and permanence, seeing him as a savior from the Lady of Dreams. The Returned Sentries are their followers, all conducting a ritual to communicate with Underworld souls. If the party shows themselves or is discovered, the creatures only demand silence and are not aggressive unless the ritual is interrupted.
    - **Outcome:** Their attempt fails: lacking their other halves, these beings haven’t kept their true magical knowledge nor the means to pursue it, living in hiding from the Mistress of Death's servants. They are willing to communicate, and two scenarios might play out:
        - **Friendly:** Returned Kakomantis propose that if heroes seek Telamok, they might discover and bring back arcane knowledge (spell scrolls, magic items, Damon’s spellbook). Their reward: as runaways from the Lady of Dreams, they seek only to maintain their existence. Once they understand Damon’s methods, they might be the only ones willing to share his secrets, allowing heroes to become immortal.
        - **Adversarial:** If heroes are adversarial or uninterested, the Returned might try to take their Burnished Dragonlord Coin and brave the Necropolis themselves. They might fight violently to take it or attempt to trick heroes with fakes.

- **51-55: Returned Theatre** Eventually, the Path of the Dead passes between two mountains with various cave entrances. A perceptive hero might hear a low, guttural chant, and any character would hear it approaching any cave. This is a tunnel system, and moving deeper is concerning as it’s easy to get lost. It’s not a full maze, and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check is enough to exit without a guide.
    - **Discovery:** It doesn’t take long to find the chanting's source: a group of 12 Returned Drifters, with a single weakly lit torch in the middle of the room. 10 are sitting, leaning against the rock, staring at a wall, while 2 use their hands, differently shaped rocks, and sticks to create shadowy forms. They chant and move against the light, emulating movements.
    - **Performance:** Whatever story is being told seems deeply poor. Figures (if they can be called that, as Returned cannot create recognizable shadows) act like they speak, but no words are discernible. They seem to walk but never run or reach a location. Sometimes, shadows become static. From time to time, Returned swap places, and their shadow theater continues.
    - **Interaction:** When heroes arrive, they do not interrupt. Some glance, one might point to the floor, offering a seat, but all quickly turn back to the walls. Any conversation with Drifters is dry. This brand of Returned is incredibly passive, unknowingly devoid of most things that made them mortals, answering questions with bland, monotone voices. They might have particular reactions to specific Epic Paths (e.g., scared of a Doomed One or identifying with a soul-empty Masterpiece). They existed in Telamok like others of their kind, escaping Lutheria’s minions, finding refuge in these caves, filling their days with mundane shadow plays. They have no objectives or purpose beyond this.

- **56-60: Returned Drifters** The party encounters a large number of Returned: 3d8 Returned Drifters.
    - **Nature:** These are the most devoid of energy and emotion, doing nothing but wandering Telamok in search of the next safe haven from beasts, monsters, and Lutheria's minions.
    - **Tactics:** They may fight if heroes initiate conflict, doing so with empty abandon, but would rather just keep walking.

- **86-95: Graxis, the Minotaur** If heroes are lucky (or unlucky), they will hear terrible roars echoing through the mountains. No matter how far from the Necropolis, the sound reaches far and wide, almost as if directly in front of them.
    - **Discovery:** As they march, the party will find the beast. Walking high on one of Telamok’s mountains, the roar echoes again, but this time its origin is visible: looking down and away, an enormous humanoid figure with horns stands out. It has another humanoid stuck to one of its horns, bleeding profusely, and now walks back towards Telamok.

- **96-100: Marching Dead** As the heroes walk high across one of the mountains, they can hear heavy steps far below, as if a giant walked around Telamok.
    - **Discovery:** If heroes carefully walk to the mountain edge, they’ll observe from afar: not a huge being, but an army marching. They bear no colors in armor, capes, or skin, instead forming a wave of monotone gray. However, their shields bear emblems: an enormous dragon rounding across the bronze. Even without colors, it is undeniably Balmytria, the silver dragon, symbol of Mytros.
    - **Nature & Effect:** This is a memory of the land, a historical afterimage given form by the heavy emotional toll from the Dragonlords, Necropolis construction, and Damon’s tapping into the underworld. They are not ghosts, wraiths, or undead, but more akin to a mirage that marches, fights an absent enemy, and disappears only to reappear eventually. Kyrah might be the only one who has heard about such things. She’ll warn them of stories about being forced to march with them if approached.
    - **Outcome:** If the party approaches, they’ll feel a wave of pride and rage, and should roll a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw: on a failure, a hero will believe themselves part of the pack, marching for glory against an unknown enemy, and will need to be stopped by fellows or Kyrah. Otherwise, they will march for 48 hours without stopping, likely accruing exhaustion, stopping only when the mirage vanishes and their mind returns.

## Loot Encounters (Roll 96-100 on Encounter Type)
If the first d100 roll is between 96 and 100, the party will find a loot encounter. These encounters offer findings and discoveries usually tied to positive rewards, useful objects, or information a party could use at some point in the campaign, though not necessarily.

**Roll d100 for Specific Loot Encounter:**
- **01-10: Corrupted Flora** The Oldwoods are Thylea's richest section for flora and fauna, the go-to for plants for medicine or poison. Around the dead mountain Telamok, one sees mostly dry land and stone, with rare bushes or short trees; no one would expect more.
    - **Discovery:** Sometimes, however, they would be wrong. Just as some fauna has been warped by Damon’s methods and Lutheria’s retaliation, the same is true for some surviving plants. Warped with necrotic energy, these are now prime ingredients for poisons tied to the Nether Sea, Underworld, and Lady of Dreams. These are rare substances, likely coveted by assassins, executors, cultists, and merchants.
    - **Type & Effect:** Players should roll an additional 1d4, defining the kind of plant and the poison it produces. Specific kinds and effects are in [[Part X]] of this Divine Guide, but here's a summary:
        - **1: Akoniton, wolf’s-bane.** Can be crushed into a paste and smeared on objects; contact with victims generates euphoria, convulsions, then death.
        - **2: Anemone, windflower.** Can be mixed into edibles, damaging consumer and causing severe mouth pain, stopping coherent speech.
        - **3: Asphodel, food of the dead.** If a flower is eaten whole, it will temporarily stop their heart.
        - **4: Mithridate.** Small blood-red fruit. Needs no preparation: if chewed for at least 1 hour, grants resistance to poison for 24 hours.
    - **Collection:** These plants can be collected and preserved with a successful DC 15 Survival (Wisdom) check. They will find the amount necessary for one single usage of the poison’s intended effect.

- **11-20: Weakened Driftglobe** This was the last treasure of a self-exiled madman. It was once a complete Driftglobe but is now cracked and dirty, unable to emanate the Daylight spell.
    - **Properties:** It otherwise has all capabilities of the completed item, and perhaps can be fixed by Volkan, God of Forges.

- **21-30: Spell Scroll** The party finds an improvised spell scroll, likely the product of the few Masters of Souls or Returned Kakomantis present around these mountains.
    - **Spell:** Players should roll an additional 1d4, which will define the specific spell:
        - **1:** Unseen Servant
        - **2:** Cause Fear
        - **3:** Wither and Bloom
        - **4:** Dust Devil

- **31-60: Trinket** The party discovers an old and all but useless trinket, likely abandoned by one of the citizens of these mountains, like those found in “Encounter: Hands of Kentimane,” at the beginning of the Path of the Dead.
    - **Examples:** A broken urn, now devoid of ashes; a dirty and broken golden mask, likely the only remains of a gone Returned; a piece of poetry from a father who lost his son; etc.

- **61-70: Pendant of Longing** The heroes come across an old jewel: it seems to be rose quartz or a similar precious stone, caged in bronze fitting in the form of a broken wing. This is a Pendant of Longing. All additional items can be found at Part Y of this Divine Guide.
    - **History:** This object was once carried into Telamok by a man whose wife, a Mytrosian warrior, committed a crime and chose to self-exile around Telamok instead of death by dragon. He likely looked for her until the end of his days.

- **71-80: Divine Figure** The heroes come across an idol of a particular god, but tainted by time, the elements, or its previous owner.
    - **Examples:** A figure of Lutheria might be bloodied, a small statue of Volkan might be missing his arms, a statue of Kyrah might be missing her mouth, and so on. This purposeful damage might have been caused by one of the iconoclasts living around Telamok.

- **81-90: Oh, Painful Muse** The party discovers a single instrument: a lyre, an aulos, or a kithara.
    - **Properties:** It’s dirty and seems old, but is otherwise surprisingly functional. A character who tries to play it cannot help but shed a few tears, as if deep sorrow has suddenly touched them.

- **91-95: Pipe of Remembrance** The heroes find one Pipe of Remembrance.
    - **History:** This item looks old and has probably had many owners throughout the decades, always aiding the self-exiles who could not abandon what once was.

- **96-98: Night Caller** The heroes discover a single Night Caller amidst old debris by the side of the Path.
    - **History & Recognition:** This was the single crown jewel of a former cultist of Lutheria, a woman who truly believed the Mistress of Death was always fascinated by dragons. She was correct, but the Cult would never hear it, much less allow an impious mage the authority to deal with the dead in the name of the Lady of Dreams, and so she chose to flee Mytros before she could be exiled, living a lonely life in ode of her patron goddess. If this whistle is ever taken to Mytros, it would be recognized by Trellus, Septia, and Chondrus. The couple would see it in bad faith, expecting ignorance from the Heroes of Prophecy, but Chondrus would see it with good eyes. Any of them could share this story.
 
- **99-100: Stone of Ill Luck** The heroes discover a single Stone of Ill Luck.

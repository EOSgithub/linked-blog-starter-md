### Phase 1: Steal the Horn of Balmytria
This is pretty much the first thing [[Demetria]] does. What changes her is [[Demetria]]’s PURPOSE for stealing the Horn. In addition to granting [[Demetria]] the ritual to produce maenads, [[Lutheria]] provided [[Demetria]] with a ritual to use the wine from the Horn of Balmytria to forcefully convert human females into maenads with none of the hoops, driving them mad instantly and overwriting any personality they might have had. The corrupted wine also has this effect on human males, converting them into crazed satyrs that are just as devoted to her. Similarly, any existing fey become maddened and devoted if they drink the wine.

In my version, the Horn lets [[Demetria]] scale up her operation and recruit new allies by force, giving her access to more and stronger minions. 

**Running the Mossy Temple Without [[Demetria]]**
In my version of the story, [[Demetria]] and the bulk of her forces will have already left the Mossy Temple to commence with Phase 2. The Mossy Temple can still largely be run as written, with the following changes:
- Have Loreus escape with Corinna. He tried to set her free when [[Demetria]] began forcing the wine of the Horn on his [[Satyr]] brethren.
- Herkus was a druid of the Oldwood that learned of [[Demetria]]’s plan for Phase 2. As a result, she transfigured him so that he could not warn his brethren.
- Have the litter of [[Satyr]] and goatling bacchanals litter the surrounding forest, showing the signs of a much larger force having been here previously.
- Change the stoned-kids-room into a hiding place for the children – a place Loreus tried to squirrel them away until he could figure out a safe way to move them. Alternatively, you can have all the children be converted into maenads and satyrs, if you and your players are okay with a darker game.
- Have the visiting dryad and satyrs arrive “too late” to stop [[Demetria]], telling the party that she plans to attack the druids of the Oldwood and their patron, Prosymeina (see Phase 2). They can answer many of the party’s questions about what [[Demetria]] plans to do next in Phase 2, although they believe her plan is doomed.
- Change the final boss of the feast hall into Xaricus, a bloated, fattened [[Satyr]] that [[Demetria]] left behind. His is corpulent and can barely move, instead having goatlings bring the butchered remains of the children to feed him. Xaricus can use a toned-down version of the bonfire king (BoBH p.67). If you want to roll your own, make him a stationary bag of HP that summons maenads, goatlings, and uses firebolts and confusion spells to mess with the party. Xaricus can also boast to the party of [[Demetria]]’s plan for Phase 2, if they haven’t learned of it already.
- You can have the Horn of Balmytria be present here, with Xaricus chugging merrily on it. However, if you suspect the players will not care about the druids enough to pursue [[Demetria]], you can have her take it with her.


#### Phase 2 – Take the Heart of the Oldwood
This phase requires a little background and will do the most to expand on the game’s existing lore.

##### Prosymeina and the Heart of the Oldwood
The Heart of the Oldwood is the oldest tree in the forest, an offshoot of [[Thylea]]’s great tree itself and many miles east of the Mossy Temple. The Heart’s dryad, Prosymeina, is immensely powerful (a verdant sorcery green enchantress (BoBH p.22, but any caster CR ~15 will do)). Prosymeina leads the druids of the Oldwood and teaches them how to live in harmony with [[Thylea]] and her ways. It is thought that she can commune directly with [[Thylea]]. She is also an ancestor of [[Demetria]]’s, and although she is far stronger and older than her, all dryads of the Oldwood swore an oath long ago never to harm one another or their trees. This means Prosymeina cannot act against [[Demetria]], or her fey forces (with whom [[Demetria]] swore an Oath of Fellowship, broadening the protection to all of them).

##### Demetria’s Plan
[[Demetria]] will assault the Heart of the Oldwood, forcing Prosymeina and the druids to abandon the tree, lest [[Demetria]] kill all of Prosymeina’s followers. She will then have set up a riotous bacchanal around the Heart, shielding herself with many waves of maenads and satyrs. Prosymeina will be annoyed by this at best – [[Demetria]] has no hope of holding her tree forever, and Prosymeina need only find a way of breaking the oath before she can wrest control back from her.

##### Involving the Players
[[Demetria]] will already have possession of the Heart by the time the party learns of her plan, and will have more than enough satyrs, maenads, goatlings, and other like-minded dryads to deal with them if they assault her head-on. Instead, they need to bargain with Prosymeina to gain the proper tools to retake the Heart. Have the party encounter an increasing deluge of [[Demetria]]’s minions as they pursue her. When all seems lost, a pair of druids or dryad huntresses (you could use amazon statblocks, or sisters of the vale (BoBH p.18) intervenes and pulls them away. The party will then be taken to Prosymeina herself, who will inform the party of the following:

She considers [[Demetria]]’s act petty revenge for Prosymeina not aiding her against [[Estor Arkelander]], done only to humiliate her. In this instance, A bit of Prosymeina’s hubris is shining through, as she sees [[Demetria]] as mostly a petulant child.

She could easily defeat [[Demetria]], but needs her oath broken to do it. Breaking Prosymeina’s oath is where the party comes in, and should be a small quest all its own. How the party can aid Prosymeina is up to you, but here are some ideas:
- The party may be powerful enough to, with the aid of the other druids, turn the tide on their own. What will follow is a small battle between the players + their druid allies against [[Demetria]]’s corrupted fey. In this case the battle should be very difficult, with the party only succeeding through tactical brilliance.
- Using her connection to [[Thylea]], Prosymeina can commune with [[The Fates]] to have her oath broken. Of course, she will have already tried this, but perhaps with the players in attendance they can offer something of interest to [[The Fates]]. Whatever you choose, it should not be easily repeatable; oaths should not so easily be broken. Again, your choice as to what, but here are some ideas:
	- A [[Game of Twenty Squares]], with Loreus’s life wagered against Prosymeina’s oath;
	- An unnamed favor that the party must complete for [[The Fates]] later, at the least opportune moment;
	- A beloved NPC will be magically compelled to hate the players;
	- Convert a PC’s class into a Pact of [[The Fates]] warlock.
- The party may try to sneak into [[Demetria]]’s bacchanal, using hidden paths shown to them by the druids. This way they could take out [[Demetria]] directly, with only a handful of minions to protect her. Regardless of what Prosymeina desires and what the players do, once they have a solid plan of attack they can progress to Phase 3.


#### Phase 3 – Battle of the Heart
The party/the druids of the Oldwood, including Prosymeina if they unbound her oath, will attack [[Demetria]] to reclaim their land. If they do not, she will continue to press her advantage and attack the druids again, this time with no hope of escape. 

Unbeknownst to anyone, defeat is what [[Demetria]] desires. Using her depraved bacchanal around the Heart, [[Demetria]] bound her soul to the tree in addition to Prosymeina’s. When [[Demetria]] is slain, her mind will invade Prosymeina’s the next time she sleeps, supplanting her and giving her the power of the greatest dryad in all of [[Thylea]]. 

Whether the party attacks [[Demetria]] or the other way around, this will appear to be the epic final battle. I recommend multiple encounters with shambling mounds, maenads, satyrs, and all sorts of other crazy stuff as the party participates in the battle. If Prosymeina joins them, I suggest she mainly fight offscreen so that she doesn’t outshine the party, but be clear that they are trouncing the overall fight because of her presence. You may have her join the final rounds of the fight with [[Demetria]] if things are going poorly.

##### Roleplaying Demetria
If things are going according to plan, this is the first time the players meet [[Demetria]]. In the context of battle, [[Demetria]] is cold and cruel to the heroes, venting all her rage about Estor to them. She taunts them for all the children they failed to save, and grows furious whenever she is hit by or misses an attack.

[[Demetria]] is all too happy to play the part of a depraved, vengeful murderess. She knows the party will be more likely to kill her that way, and that is what she ultimately desires. I suggest beefing up her statblock substantially (perhaps a reskin of the other dryads in Odyssey, or even a Conclave Dryad from Guildmaster’s Guide to Ravnica) and give her maenad, awakened tree, and faun (BoBH p.68) minions.

To compensate for the big power spike, give players sisters of the vale, wolf, and druid companions to help distribute the damage, this should be a big setpiece fight – in a way, [[Demetria]] will see to it that it is.

##### Resolution
After a hard boss battle with a lot of buildup, your players will likely assume that the battle is over unless you hint otherwise. [[Demetria]] will be slain, her followers scattered, and Prosymeina will be in their debt. Let the players revel in the victory, likely receiving a charm or two from Prosymeina, and let them count their first labor done. The remaining phases of [[Demetria]]’s schemes will take place between labors and Mytros, as [[Demetria]] slowly uses her new position as Prosymeina to turn the druids and, later, Estoria…

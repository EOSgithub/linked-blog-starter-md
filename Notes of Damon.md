_From the observations of Damon, Guardian of Telamok_

The young man had been waiting patiently for hours, reading a book on the bridge. When I materialized beside him, he turned with a smile that seemed genuinely pleased rather than surprised.

"Guardian," he said with careful respect. "Thank you for hearing me out."

I gestured inquiringly. He could speak freely—the dead were excellent listeners after all.

"I've come about my work: the Eighth Configuration, it's nearly complete, but requires... expertise in transitions. Between life and what lies beyond. And who better to ask than you?"

I tilted my head, studying him more closely. There was something unusual about this one— scar patterns burned into his skin in precise lines. And his shadow... I looked down, then around him. No shadow at all. Curious.

"The theory is sound," he continued. "Freedom from predetermined fate, from divine whim."

I crossed my arms and shook my head slowly. My days of glory were decidedly concluded.

"I understand your reluctance," he said quietly. "You've seen what happens when mortals try to reshape the order of things. But what if the price this time isn't war? What if freedom could be achieved through understanding rather than conquest?"

I pointed to myself, then made a cutting gesture across my throat. No more adjustments. My oath was to guard the dead, nothing more.

"The dead you guard died for an oath that brought a temporary peace," he replied. "This could bring everlasting freedom. To every mortal who's ever wondered why their fate was decided by beings they never chose to serve."

"Excuse me," came a voice from behind us, slightly breathless from their recent trials. "Sorry to interrupt."

The young man turned toward the approaching party with genuine courtesy. "Not an interruption at all. Well met."

"And you are?" Bayle asked, his professional wariness evident but polite.

"I go by the Deliverer these days," the young man replied with a self-deprecating smile. "I realize how that sounds—quite ominous, really. I don't fault you for any suspicion. I'm here researching some rather obscure knowledge, hoping to convince our friend Damon to assist with a project."

"What kind of project?" Asterius asked with his usual cheerful curiosity.

The Deliverer started to respond, then stopped mid-sentence, his attention suddenly fixed on Asterius. I watched as something flickered across his face—recognition.

"I... forgive me," he said, visibly collecting himself with scholarly embarrassment. "You reminded me of something quite unexpected. Where are my manners?"

I realized what he was seeing. 
Interesting that this "Deliverer" could perceive it.

"No offense taken." Asterius replied with his usual good humor.

The Deliverer turned back to me. "Well, Guardian, I've presented my case as best I can. The offer remains open, naturally."

He addressed the party with genuine warmth. "It's been delightful meeting you all. Please, take care of each other—and of our guardian here."

With that, he unhurriedly walked away.
What a strange man.

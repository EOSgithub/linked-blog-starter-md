_From the observations of Damon, Guardian of Telamok_

The young man had waited three hours at the bridge's edge. When I materialized beside him, his smile held no surprise, only friendly satisfaction.

"Guardian." He bowed. "Thank you for hearing me."

I gestured: _Speak._

"The Eighth Configuration nears completion. But I need expertise in... transitions. Between life and what lies beyond."

Geometric burn scars webbed his skin like calculated wounds. I glanced down—no shadow followed him. Interesting.

"Its purpose is freedom," he continued. "From predetermined fate. From divine whim."

I crossed my arms, shook my head. Those days were behind me.

"I understand." His voice softened. "You've seen what happens when mortals reshape the order of things. But what if this time the price isn't war? What if freedom came through understanding, not conquest?"

I drew a finger across my throat. _No more interventions._ My oath was to the dead alone.

"The dead you guard died for a temporary peace," he countered. "This could bring lasting freedom. For every mortal who never chose the gods and titans that rule them."

Movement caught our attention—a mythrall dragon, silver-blue scales glinting, creeping along the bridge's shadow.

"Your friend seems curious," the Deliverer noted, amused. "No need to hide."

The dragon froze, caught too far away to have heard anything useful.

"And here come the others."

The chaotic group of adveturers approached, battered but triumphant from the trial of the tombs.

"Good afternoon." The Deliverer bowed deeply. "Forgive any alarm. I was merely seeking your guardian's wisdom."

"And you are?" Bayle's professional wariness sharpened his tone.

"The Deliverer, these days." Self-deprecation touched his smile. "Ominous title, I know. Can't fault the suspicion."

"What were you discussing?" Asterius asked.

The Deliverer began to answer, then stopped cold. His gaze fixed on Asterius with sudden, unmistakable recognition. His scarred hands trembled.

"I... forgive me." He recovered poorly. "You reminded me of something... unexpected."

Whatever he'd seen, he buried it quickly.

Turning back to me: "Well, Guardian, my offer stands."

To the party, with genuine warmth: "Delightful meeting you all. Take care of each other—and of him."

He crossed the bridge with measured calm, leaving questions in his wake.

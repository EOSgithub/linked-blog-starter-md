The door to our apartment opened just after midnight, and I knew immediately something was wrong.

The Deliverer never made noise when he entered—part of his careful, calculated nature—but tonight he leaned heavily against the doorframe as if the simple act of turning the handle had exhausted him.

I set aside the book I'd been reading and rose from my chair by the window. "How did it go?"

He didn't answer immediately. Instead, he closed the door behind him and simply stood there, staring at nothing. His hair was disheveled, his robes wrinkled.

"It worked," he said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.

But there was no triumph in his tone. Just bone-deep weariness and something that sounded almost like grief.

"You succeded?"

A nod. "She's alive. The queen, I mean. Changed, but alive."

The way he said it told me everything. This hadn't gone as he'd hoped.

I moved toward him carefully, the way one approaches a wounded animal. Up close, I could see the toll the night had taken. His usually perfect composure had cracked completely, and his eyes held a depth of sorrow that made my chest ache.

"Sit," I said gently, guiding him to the worn armchair by the small fireplace. "Tell me what happened."

He sank into the chair like a man twice his age. For a moment, he just stared into the dying embers, and I thought he might not answer. Then, quietly, he began to speak.

"She was terrified. At the end, she was so afraid." His voice cracked. "She begged me to stop. Called me a liar. Said I'd promised her freedom, but all I'd given her was death."

I'd never seen him like this. In the months since we'd both found ourselves in Lutheria's service, he had always been composed, brilliant, absolutely certain in his purpose. Even when discussing the most difficult tasks our mistress set for us, he maintained that calm scholarly demeanor. But now...

"You saved lives," I reminded him, settling onto the small stool beside his chair. "You said yourself—what you prevented would have been catastrophic."

"I know." The words came out flat, defeated. "I know it was necessary. I know this was the only way." He looked at me then, and I saw something that made my heart ache. "But knowing doesn't make it easier to bear."

I reached out and took his trembling hand in both of mine. "What else happened? There's something you're not telling me."

A long pause. Then: "Her husband tried to save her. And... and I let him. I could have stopped him, but I didn't." He gestured vaguely at himself. "I paid a price for that mercy. But she's alive because of it."

"Cosmo..."

"Do you know what the worst part is?" He continued as if I hadn't spoken. "For just a moment, while it was happening, I thought about letting it finish completely. Just for a heartbeat, I considered it. It would have been so much simpler, so much cleaner..."

I could see the self-loathing in his expression, the way this momentary thought had added another layer to his guilt.

"But you didn't," I said firmly. "You chose mercy. You saved her."

"Did I? Or did I just condemn her to a diminished life because I couldn't follow through completely?" He laughed bitterly. "Either way, I'm becoming exactly what Lutheria needs me to be."

I stood up abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor. The sound made him look up, startled.

"Stop it," I said, my voice sharper than I'd intended. "Just... stop."

"Aria—"

"No. I won't listen to you torture yourself like this." I moved to our small kitchen area and began preparing tea—chamomile and lavender, the blend our landlady had recommended for sleepless nights. "You want to know what you're becoming? You're someone who still chooses compassion when you could choose efficiency. You're someone who sits here afterward, broken up about the pain you caused someone you barely knew."

I could hear him shifting in his chair behind me, but he didn't respond.

"Lutheria sent you when she could have sent Chondrus to do what you did tonight," I continued, measuring out the dried herbs. "Someone who wouldn't have cared about the cost. Someone who wouldn't have hesitated, or shown mercy."

"Maybe that would have been better—"

"Would it?" I turned to face him, the tea steeping in my hands. "She chose you for a reason, Cosmo. Maybe because she knew you'd do the job. Or maybe because she knew it would break something inside you, and that's what she wanted. But you still have a choice about who you become after."

He stared at me for a long moment, something unreadable flickering across his features. Then, slowly, some of the tension seemed to drain from his shoulders.

"When did you become so wise?" he asked quietly.

"Someone has to keep you grounded." I brought him the tea and settled back onto my stool. "Besides, we're both stuck in this mess together. Might as well look after each other."

Cosmo accepted the cup gratefully, wrapping his hands around the warm ceramic. We sat in comfortable silence for a while, listening to the distant sounds of the city settling into sleep. Some color gradually returned to his face as the tea worked its magic.

"She'll want a report tomorrow," he said eventually, meaning Lutheria.

"I'll help you write it. We can focus on the success and leave out the... personal details."

He nodded, then looked at me with something that might have been curiosity. "You could ask her for different duties, you know. She might grant it, if you phrase it right."

I met his gaze steadily. "And what exactly would I do instead? Organize her library? Tend her gardens? Stand around looking decorative while she holds court?"

"You could have an easier life. Less... complicated."

The suggestion was so absurd I almost laughed. "Cosmo, do you remember the day our adventure ended? In her chambers, after we'd both lost everything to her champion's wager?"

He frowned, clearly struggling to focus through his exhaustion. "You said... you said you weren't going to beg for mercy. That if she wanted to break you, she'd have to work for it."

"And you said that was either very brave or very stupid."

"I still think it might have been both."

"Maybe. But do you remember what else you said? You said that if we were going to survive this, we'd need to find something worth preserving in ourselves. Something she couldn't take away." 

"I found mine. Did you think I was going to abandon it now just because things got difficult?"

Understanding dawned in his tired eyes.

"Besides," I added with a small smile, "someone needs to make sure you still remember how to be human. And someone needs to make sure you eat properly and sleep occasionally instead of staying up all night planning theorems."

For the first time since he'd walked through the door, he smiled. It was small, tired, but genuine.

"You're stubborn," he said.

"I learned from an excellent teacher."

He finished his tea and set the cup aside, then pushed himself up from the chair with obvious effort. At the doorway to his small bedroom, he paused.

"Thank you," he said simply."

"Thank you for coming back," I replied. "Every time."

After he disappeared into his room, I remained by the dying fire for a while longer.

In the morning, Cosmo would put his mask back on. He would be brilliant and focused and terrifyingly capable again. But tonight, for just a few hours, he had been allowed to be human.

And I would make sure he never lost that completely, no matter what Lutheria asked of us next.
